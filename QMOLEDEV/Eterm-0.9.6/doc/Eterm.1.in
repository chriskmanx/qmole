.SH NAME
Eterm - the Enlightened terminal emulator for the X Window System
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Eterm
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Eterm
\(em version
.B @VERSION@
\(em is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as an
.IR xterm (1)
replacement. It is designed with a Freedom of Choice philosophy, leaving as
much power, flexibility, and freedom as possible in the hands of the user.
It is designed to look good and work well, but takes a feature-rich approach
rather than one of minimalism.
.B Eterm
uses Imlib for advanced graphic abilities.  See below for details.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B Eterm
options are listed below.
In keeping with the freedom-of-choice philosophy, options may be eliminated
or default values chosen at compile-time, so options and defaults listed
may not accurately reflect the version installed on your system.

Options that do not take a parameter (besides -h and --help) are boolean.  If
you use the POSIX (short) option, you are forcing the parameter to "true".  If
you use the long option, you can use any of the accepted boolean values, which
are "yes", "on", "1", and "true" to turn the option on, or "no", "off", "0", or
"false" to turn the option off.  The same is true for boolean values in the
configuration file.
.LP
.TP
.BI \-t " theme" ", \-\-theme " theme
Load specified
.I theme\.
Consult the FAQ for more details on what constitutes an Eterm
.I theme\.
.TP
.BI \-X " conffile" ", \-\-config-file " conffile
Use an alternative user config file name.  Otherwise Eterm uses the default,
which is 
.I user.cfg\.
The theme config file is always
.I theme.cfg\.
.TP
.BI \-d " displayname" ", \-\-display " displayname
Attempt to open a window on the named X display
.I displayname.
In the absence of this option, the display specified by the
.B DISPLAY
environment variable is used.
.TP
.BI \-\-debug " level"
Show debugging output.
.I level
is an integer between 0 and 5 which determines how verbose the debugging
output is.
.TP
.B \-\-install
Tells Eterm to install its own colormap rather than using the default
one.
.TP
.BR "\-h" , " \-\-help"
Print out a message describing available options.
.TP
.BR \-\-version

Reverse video, swaps the foreground and background colors.
.TP
.BI \-b " color" ", \-\-background-color " color
Set
.I color
as the background color.
.B NOTE:
this will actually be the foreground color if reverse video is also
selected.
.TP
.BI \-f " color" ", \-\-foreground-color " color

.I color
as the foreground (text) color.
.B NOTE:
this will actually be the background color if reverse video is also
selected.

.I color
as the pointer color.
.TP
.BI \-c " color" ", \-\-cursor-color " color
Use
.I color
as the cursor color.
.TP
.BI \-\-cursor-text-color " color"
Use
.I color
as the cursor text color.
.TP
.BI \-g " geom" ", \-\-geometry " geom
Window geometry as Width x Height+X coord+Y coord, i.e 100x200+0+100
.TP
.BR "\-i" , "\-\-iconic"
Start in iconified state (only if the window manager supports
iconification).
.TP
.BI \-n " name" ", \-\-name " name
Sets name of current instance to
.I name.
This will affect the icon title and the window title string unless
they are otherwise explicitly set.
.TP
.BI \-T " title" ", \-\-title " title
Sets window's title text to
.I title.
.TP
.BI \-\-icon-name " text"
Sets the icon title text to
.I text.
.TP
.BI \-B " type" ", \-\-scrollbar-type " type
Specifies the
.I type
scrollbar style should be used.
.I type
can be any of
.BR "motif" ", " "xterm" ", or " "next" "."
.TP
.BI \-\-scrollbar-width " width"
Set the width of the scrollbar, in pixels, to
.IR width "."
Eterm does not impose any restrictions on this value, but it should be reasonable.
.TP
.BI \-D " desktop" ", \-\-desktop " desktop
Starts the Eterm on the specified desktop.
.I desktop
should be an integer between 0 and your highest-numbered desktop.
.BR "NOTE" ":  "
You must have a GNOME-compliant window manager for this feature to work.  Please see
http://www.gnome.org/devel/gnomewm/ for more information on the
.B _WIN_WORKSPACE
property and how to support it.
.TP
.BI \-\-line-space " num"
Size of the extra gap, in pixels, to provide between lines in the terminal window.
.TP
.BI \-\-bold-font " font"
Sets the bold text font to
.IR font .
.TP
.BI \-F " font" ", \-\-font " font
Sets the normal text font to
.IR font .
.TP
.BI \-\-default-font\-index " num"
Specifies the index of the default (normal) text font.
.TP
.BI \-\-font1 " font"
.TP
.BI ...
.TP
.BI \-\-font4 " font"
Sets the font at the specified index (1-4) to
.IR font .
.TP
.BR \-\-proportional
Specifies that the font in use is proportional and requests standard
deviation-based character cell spacing.  Terminals must use
fixed-width character cells to maintain proper columnal alignment,
even when proportionally-spaced fonts are in use.  Some
proportionally-spaced fonts vary greatly between the minimum and
maximum character widths.  This option chooses a character cell size
which is up to two standard deviations above the average character
width but will not exceed the maximum width of the largest glyph.
Note that characters larger than the chosen cell width will overwrite
(or be overwritten by) other characters and may tend to leave pixel
droppings.  This behavior is an expected side-effect of an imperfect
scenario.  If you object to this behavior, do not use this option.
.TP
.BI \-\-font-fx " effects"
Specifies the effects to apply to the terminal window font.  The value
of
.I effects
is a single string containing a series of corner/color pairs.  These
pairs define toward which corner a drop shadow of each character
should be made, and what color that shadow will be.  The corner is
specified first using the following keywords:
.BR top_left " or " tl ", "
.BR top_right " or " tr ", "
.BR bottom_left " or " bl ", and "
.BR bottom_right " or " br .
Each corner specifier is then followed by a color.

There are also several shortcuts for doing common effects.  You can
get a single-color outline by using the keyword
.B outline
followed by a color.  A single-color drop shadow is also available
using the keyword
.B shadow
followed by an optional corner specifier
.BR "" "(" bottom_right " being the default)"
and a color.  For a 3-D embossed look, use
.BI emboss " dark_color"
.IR light_color .
The opposite effect, a carved-out look, can be obtained with
.BI carved " dark_color"
.IR light_color .
(Of course, with those last two, the 3-D look will only work if you
choose the light and dark colors wisely.)

Finally, for no font effects at all, simply specify the keyword
.BR none .

The default value is
.B bottom_right black
which yields a black drop shadow, greatly improving the visibility of
lightly-colored fonts on top of light spots in a background image.
Note that font effects are not active in solid color mode.
.TP
.BI \-P " pic" ", \-\-background-pixmap " pic
Use
.I pic
as the background image.
.I pic
can be in any format that Imlib understands.  Currently this means just
about anything, including JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, PPM, etc.  The image is
tiled by default.  To specify alternate geometry, follow the filename
with an
.B @
sign and the geometry string.  Image geometry is specified as
.BI @ w x h + x + y : ops
where
.IR w " and " h
are the horizontal/vertical scaling percentages,
.IR x " and " y
are the horizontal/vertical alignment percentages, and
.I ops
is a colon-delimited list of operations:
.BR tiled " (to tile the image), "
.BR propscaled " (for proportional scaling)."
Note that these operations can be combined for various effects.
.TP
.BI \-I " pic" ", \-\-icon " pic
Sets the icon pixmap file to
.IR "pic" "."
Works similarly to the
.B -P
option above.
.TP
.BI \-\-up-arrow-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's up-arrow is set.  
.TP
.BI \-\-down-arrow-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's down-arrow is set.
.TP
.BI \-\-trough-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's background (trough) is set.
.TP
.BI \-\-anchor-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's anchor image is set.
.TP
.BI \-\-menu-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the menu background image is set.
.TP
.BR "\-O" , " \-\-trans"
This gives a pseudo-transparent Eterm.  The image is taken directly from the
root window, so any requests for changing the pixmap are ignored.  If you do
not use Enlightenment (http://www.enlightenment.org/) as your window manager
(or another compliant window manager...I have been told that WindowMaker works
also), you will need to use the
.I Esetroot
program (found in the
.B utils/
directory) to set your root background image.
.TP
.BR \-0 ", " \-\-itrans
Activate the immotile transparency optimization for transparent Eterm
windows.  Note that this does NOT activate transparency; you must
still include the
.BR \-O " or " \-\-trans
option.  This option should be used on transparent windows which are
shaded or tinted and which do not move around on the desktop much.
See the
.B "Mon Mar  6 21:11:13 PST 2000"
ChangeLog entry for a more detailed explanation.
.TP
.BR \-\-viewport-mode
This activates a special Eterm mode which is hard to describe in words.
Basically, imagine the effect you get with pseudo-transparency, where
the desktop background moves through the Eterm window as you move the
window, so that it always aligns with the desktop image.  Now, imagine
the same effect, but the image used isn't the desktop image but any
pixmap you choose.  The image is scaled or tiled up to the size of the
desktop, and dragging the Eterm around the screen reveals different
portions of the image as you move, much like a small viewport window
in a ship or submarine does.  The effect is especially keen if you
open several Eterms in this mode with the same image.
.TP
.BI \-\-shade " percentage"
Shade the background image/transparency by a specified percentage.
.TP
.BI \-\-tint " mask"
.TP
.BI \-\-tint " color"
Tints the background pixmap (either an image file or the transparent
portion can be shaded).  The
.I mask
is an integer, usually specified in hexadecimal in the form
.BR " " "0x" "RRGGBB" ","
where
.BR "RR" ", " "GG" ", and " "BB"
are hexadecimal numbers between
.BR "00" " and " "ff" " (" "0" " and"
.BR "255" " decimal)"
which represent the brightness of the image's red, green, and blue
values, respectively.  A value of
.B 00
will mask that color out entirely, while a value of
.B ff
will not change that color at all.

You may also specify an X
.I color
such as
.BR grey75 " or " MidnightBlue " or " "#babb7f"
instead of a
.IR mask .
.TP
\fB\-\-cmod\fR \fIbrightness\fR [ \fIcontrast\fR [ \fIgamma \fR] ]
Specifies a color modifier to apply to the image overall.  Each of the three
values is a number greater than or equal to 0.  The numbers can be specified as
decimal, octal (if preceded by "0"), or hexadecimal (if preceded by "0x").
A value of 256 (0x100) represents 100%, or "leave that value unchanged."
0 represents 0%, 512 (0x200) is 200%, etc.  However, be aware that overflow
can occur with excessively high values.  Only the
.I brightness
value is required for this option.  Keep in mind, though, that you must
specify
.IR brightness " with " contrast ", and both of these with " gamma "."
.TP
\fB\-\-cmod\-red\fR \fIbrightness\fR [ \fIcontrast\fR [ \fIgamma \fR] ]
Same as above, except that the modifier applies to the red values of the
image.
.TP
\fB\-\-cmod\-green\fR \fIbrightness\fR [ \fIcontrast\fR [ \fIgamma \fR] ]
Same as above, except that the modifier applies to the green values of the
image.
.TP
\fB\-\-cmod\-blue\fR \fIbrightness\fR [ \fIcontrast\fR [ \fIgamma \fR] ]
Same as above, except that the modifier applies to the blue values of the
image.
.TP
.BI \-p " newpath" ", \-\-path " newpath
Sets the pic search path.  When the
.B --background-pixmap
or other pixmap options are used, this path will be used to find the
image.
.TP
.BI \-\-cache " size"
Specify the
.I size
in bytes for the Imlib2 cache.
.TP
.BI \-N " list" ", \-\-anim " list
Specifies an animation list to be use in cycling the background pixmap.  The
.I list
consists of two or more words.  The first word defines the delay, in seconds,
between updates of the background.  This should be set to a reasonable value
to insure that Eterm doesn't spend all its time rendering backgrounds.  All
remaining words specify background images and have the same syntax as
the
.B \-P
option above, including the optional geometry string.
.TP
.BI \-M " font" ", \-\-mfont " font
Sets the normal multibyte text font to
.I font.
.TP
.BI \-\-mfont1 " font"
.TP
.BI ...
.TP
.BI \-\-mfont4 " font"
Sets multibyte font X to
.I font.
.TP
.BI \-\-mencoding " encoding"
Sets multichar encoding mode (eucj or sjis or euckr)
.TP
.BI \-\-input-method " method"
Sets XIM input method
.TP
.BI \-\-preedit-type " type"
Sets XIM preedit type
.TP
.BR "\-l", " \-\-login-shell"
Makes the new shell a login shell.
.TP
.BR "\-s", " \-\-scrollbar"
Enables the scrollbar. (Default)
.TP
.BR "\-u", " \-\-utmp-logging"
Tries to enable proper utmp logging.  For this to work, Eterm probably needs
to run setuid or setgid, usually setuid root.
.TP
.BR "\-v", " \-\-visual-bell"
Enables the "visual bell".  Means the window will flash or blink rather
than beep.
.TP
.BR "\-H", " \-\-home-on-output"
Jump to bottom on output.
.TP
.BR "\-\-home-on-input"
Jump to bottom on input.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-no-input
Keeps Eterm from accepting keyboard input, and keeps the window
manager from focusing it.  Useful for log tailers and such.
.TP
.BR "\-\-scrollbar-right"
Display scrollbar on the right hand side.
.TP
.BR "\-\-scrollbar-floating"
Display the scrollbar without a trough.
.TP
.BR "\-\-scrollbar-popup"
Display the scrollbar only when the Eterm window is focused.
.TP
.BR "\-x", " \-\-borderless"
This option forces Eterm to have no borders.
.TP
.BR "\-S", " \-\-sticky"
Start Eterm as a sticky window (shows on all desktops)
.TP
.BR "\-m", " \-\-map-alert"
Un-iconify on beep.
.TP
.BR "\-8", " \-\-meta8"
Causes the Meta key to set the 8th bit in the char.
.TP
.BR "\-\-double-buffer"
Rather than drawing text directly onto the window, this option causes
Eterm to allocate an additional pixmap the size of the terminal window
into which the background *and* the text are rendered.  This pixmap is
then set as the window background.  Double-buffering uses additional
memory in the X server, but it allows Eterm to ignore expose events so
redraws are faster.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no-cursor"
Disables the text cursor.
.TP
.BR \-\-pause
After the child process terminates, Eterm will wait for a keypress
before exiting.
.TP
.BR \-\-xterm-select
Duplicate's xterm's treatment of cutchars.  The only real difference is
what happens when you double click on a single cutchar between two
words.  If this option is on, only that single character gets selected.
If it is off, that character is selected along with the two words.  The
latter behavior is useful for double-clicking on the space between someone's
first and last names, or the @ sign in an e-mail address, etc.
.TP
.BR \-\-select-line
If activated, this option causes a triple click to select the entire line
from beginning to end.  If off, a triple-click selects just from the current
word to the end of the line.
.TP
.BR \-\-select-trailing-spaces
Determines whether or not trailing spaces in a selection are maintained (on)
or discarded (off).
.TP
.BR \-\-report-as-keysyms
Reports certain keystrokes as keysyms and modifiers rather than escape sequences.
.B NOTE:
This option is intended for use only with programs that support this special Eterm
mode.  Do not enable it unless you are executing a program which uses this mode.
.TP
.BR \-\-buttonbar
Toggle the display of all buttonbars.
.TP
.BR \-\-resize-gravity
If true, Eterm will automatically detect the nearest corner, and
font-change resizes will cause the Eterm window to gravitate toward
that corner.
.TP
.BR \-\-overstrike-bold
If true (default), Eterm will simulate a bold font by printing each
character twice, offsetting the second pass by one pixel.  This makes
the characters seem thicker without the need for a special font.  You
may wish to disable this if you use a specific color for bold.
.TP
.BR \-\-bold-brightens-foreground
If true (default), Eterm will use the "bold" ANSI color attribute to
brighten the foreground color by using the high-intensity colors (8
through 15) rather than the low-intensity colors (0 through 7).  Note
that having a specific color selected for bold will override this.
.TP
.BR \-\-blink-brightens-background
If true (default), Eterm will use the "blink" ANSI color attribute to
brighten the background color by using the high-intensity colors (8
through 15) rather than the low-intensity colors (0 through 7).
.TP
.BR \-\-colors-suppress-bold
If true (default), any colored text (that is, any text not rendered
using the default foreground color) will not be given any other
special treatment for bolding (e.g., bold font or bold overstrike).
.TP
.BI \-\-big-font-key " keysym"
Specify a keysym to increase the font size.  Default is Shift and the +
key on the keypad.  Ctrl-> or Meta-> may also work (if you #define one
of the hotkeys in src/feature.h).
.TP
.BI \-\-small-font-key " keysym"
Specify a keysym to decrease the font size.  Default is Shift and the -
key on the keypad.  Ctrl-< or Meta-< may also work (if you #define one
of the hotkeys in src/feature.h).
.TP
.BI \-\-meta-mod " num"
Specify which X modifier (1-5) to treat as the Meta key.  See
.IR xmodmap (1)
and the output of
.B xmodmap -pm
for more details.
.TP
.BI \-\-alt-mod " num"
Same as
.BR \-\-meta-mod ","
but for the Alt key.
.TP
.BI \-\-numlock-mod " num"
Same as
.BR \-\-meta-mod ","
but for the NumLock key.
.TP
.BI "\-\-greek-keyboard" " mode"
Use Greek keyboard mapping (iso or ibm).
.TP
.BR \-\-app-keypad
Start Eterm in application keypad mode (as opposed to normal keypad mode).
.TP
.BR \-\-app-cursor
Start Eterm in application cursor key mode (as opposed to normal cursor
key mode).
.TP
.BI \-L " num" ", \-\-save-lines " num
Set the number of lines in the scrollback buffer to
.I num.
.TP
.BI \-a " size" ", \-\-min-anchor-size " size
Specifies the minimum size, in pixels high, of the scrollbar anchor.
.B NOTE:
This causes abnormal scrolling behavior when combined with large
scrollback buffers!
.TP
.BI \-w " width" ", \-\-border-width " width
Set the window's border width to
.I width.
The border this controls is the gap between the edge of the X window and
the edge of the terminal window; this has nothing to do with the window
border's your window manager supplies.
.TP
.BI \-\-print-pipe " pipe"
The pipe for the PrintScreen function.
.TP
.BI \-\-cut-chars " separators"
The seperators for double-click selection.
.TP
.BI \-\-finished-title " title"
Specifies the string Eterm should add to its title bar if
.B \-\-pause
is specified and the child process completes.
.TP
.BI \-\-finished-text " text"
Same as above, but displays text in the terminal window.
.TP
.BI \-\-term-name " TERM"
Use
.I TERM
for the value $TERM.
.TP
.BI \-\-pipe-name " pipe"
Specifies a named pipe from which to display output.  This is useful
for systems where syslog output goes to a named pipe, like
.B /dev/xconsole
on Debian.
.TP
.BI "\-a " "line" ", \-\-attribute " "line"
This option is used to pass config file attributes on the command
line.
.I line
should be a single string, so you will almost certainly have to quote
it.  The first word of
.I line
must be the context (see config file section below) which should parse
the rest of the
.IR line .
So, for example, you could specify the foreground color like so:
.BR "-a 'color foreground blue'" .
Or you could add a binding:
.BR "-a 'actions bind anymod button1 to script exit'" .
Note that this option may only be used with config file attributes
that are not context-sensitive; i.e., menus and imageclasses cannot be
specified using this option.
.TP
.BR "\-C", " \-\-console"
Grab console messages.  Depending on your system, Eterm may need to be
setuid root to do this.
.TP
.BI \-e " command" ", \-\-exec " command
Execute
.I command
rather than a shell. Forces Eterm mode.
.TP
.BI \-U " URL" ", \-\-url " URL
Pick up a "screen" session at
.I URL
rather than a local (-U "") one. URLs look like so
(screen://user@host.dom:port/screen_options), with all parts optional,
defaulting to "screen://current_user@localhost:22/-RDD". Forces Escreen mode,
overrides \-\-exec. Note that only screen-options (see "man screen") are
allowed; do not pass a command (with or without arguments) here: to pass
a command to the screen-session, use
.I screen [<options>] <command> [<args>]
instead.
.TP
.BI \-Z " lclport:fw:fwport,delay" ", \-\-fw " lclport:fw:fwport,delay
The URL given to \-U is in an intranet behind firewall
.I fw
so we'll build an SSH-tunnel to that firewall (to port 22/SSH, or
.I fwport
if given) from our local machine (using any available port-number, or
.I lclport
if given). Then, after
.I delay
seconds (or a sensible default if not given), we will try to open a
screen session on the host behind the firewall using
.I ssh -p localport ... localhost screen
cf.
.I ssh -L

.SH THEMES

Eterm is built on the philosophy of Freedom of Choice.  Each user
should be able to choose the environment in which he or she wishes to
exist, and the tools used should support that.  In accordance with
that philosophy, Eterm is extremely configurable.  Eterm supports a
concept called "themes," which should be familiar to users of
Enlightenment, icewm, or Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT.  The general
concept of a theme is a collection of resources that change as many
aspects of a programs look and feel as possible.  For example, an
Enlightenment theme allows you to customize menus, window borders,
desktops, icons, iconbars, and everything else about how E looks and
feels.

An Eterm theme consists of a primary configuration file, always called
"theme.cfg", residing in a directory bearing the same name as the
theme. This directory must be a child of one of the directories
specified by CONFIG_SEARCH_PATH in src/feature.h. The theme may also
contain additional configuration files referenced by the primary
theme.cfg file, as well as pixmaps, menu files, documentation, etc.,
which are allowable as extensions to the minimum requirement of an
Eterm theme.

By convention and default, Eterm themes should be stored under
~/.Eterm/themes/<theme_name>/ or @THEMEDIR@/<theme_name>.

Eterm now supports the existence of a user configuration file as a
suppliment to the theme configuration file.  The default name for this
file is user.cfg, and it follows the exact same syntax as any other
configuration file.  It is searched for using the same algorithm used
for the theme.cfg file, and any settings in the user.cfg will override
any previous values for those settings defined by the theme.  Thus, it
is recommended that any user.cfg files not be complete config files,
but rather only contain those values which the user wishes to
explicitly override.

NOTE:  If you have a user.cfg file in the Eterm theme directory or in
~/.Eterm/, it will override
.B any
previous settings, even if you are running a different theme.  For
example, if you run the trans theme, but
~/.Eterm/themes/Eterm/user.cfg has a mode line which sets the image
mode to "image" rather than "trans," you will not get transparency.
This is why user.cfg files should be kept small and only override
settings that you know you want to enforce.  If, on the other hand,
you were running the trans theme and had a user.cfg file in the trans
theme (or in ~/.Eterm/themes/trans/), that user.cfg would be found
before the one in the Eterm theme.

Almost all command line options can be enabled/disabled in the theme's
configuration file (the default is @THEMEDIR@/Eterm/theme.cfg).  The
next section contains details on the format and usage of the
configuration file.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Since Eterm @VERSION@ is based on the concept of themes, it is vital
that you have a thorough understanding of the previous section before
taking on this one.  The previous section and this one were written by
the same person who wrote the Eterm code which handles options, config
files, and themes, so it's probably the most authoritative
documentation on the subject you're going to find.

From here on out, I will assume you've read the above text and know
how to change the default value for the theme.  It is highly
recommended that you have a copy of the Eterm theme config file that
comes with Eterm handy while you read this documentation.

Okay, first the general idea.  The theme.cfg file is composed of
comments and non-comments.  Comments begin with a pound sign and
continue to the end of the line.  Lines of whitespace are also
ignored.  The rest of the file is the config stuff, which is divided
into sections (called "contexts") and variables (called "attributes").
There are several contexts which are listed below in sections.  Each
attribute must be inside a certain context to be valid.  For instance,
while the "foreground" attribute is perfectly acceptable in the color
context, it would be rejected if found in, say, the toggles context.
This allows for better organization of the config file as well as for
multiple contexts to have attributes of the same name (like the
.B scrollbar
attributes in the color and toggles section).

Each context must be enclosed in a begin...end pair that specifies the
type of section.  The statement "begin toggles" starts the toggles
context, and the next "end" statement would terminate it.  (You'll
notice that some "end" statements have the context name after them.
This is for readability only; any text after the word "end" is
ignored.)

The rest of this section will contain a step-by-step analysis of the
config file, including what can go in each section.  Note that some
attributes (and even entire contexts) may not be available depending
on what support was compiled into Eterm by the person who built it.
.LP
.TP
MAGIC NUMBER

The first line of the config file must contain a "magic number" type
line that lets Eterm verify that it's reading an Eterm config file and
not something else (like an Enlightenment 0.13 and earlier config
file).  The line should look like this:

<Eterm-VERSION>

where VERSION is the Eterm version for which the config file is
intended.  For example, config files written for Eterm 0.9 should have
"<Eterm-0.9>" as their first line, followed immediately by a newline.

where
.I W
is the width,
.I H

.RE

.BI "font default" " num"
.RS 5
Specifies that the
.IR num th
font should be considered the "default" font.
.RE

.BI "font proportional" " boolean"
.RS 5
Specifies that the font in use is proportional and requests standard
deviation-based character cell spacing.  Terminals must use
fixed-width character cells to maintain proper columnal alignment,
even when proportionally-spaced fonts are in use.  Some
proportionally-spaced fonts vary greatly between the minimum and
maximum character widths.  This option chooses a character cell size
which is up to two standard deviations above the average character
width but will not exceed the maximum width of the largest glyph.
Note that characters larger than the chosen cell width will overwrite
(or be overwritten by) other characters and may tend to leave pixel
droppings.  This behavior is an expected side-effect of an imperfect
scenario.  If you object to this behavior, do not use this option.
.RE

.BI "font fx" " effects"
.RS 5
Specifies the effects to apply to the terminal window font.  The value
of
.I effects
is a single string containing a series of corner/color pairs.  These
pairs define toward which corner a drop shadow of each character
should be made, and what color that shadow will be.  The corner is
specified first using the following keywords:
.BR top_left " or " tl ", "
.BR top_right " or " tr ", "
.BR bottom_left " or " bl ", and "
.BR bottom_right " or " br .
Each corner specifier is then followed by a color.

There are also several shortcuts for doing common effects.  You can
get a single-color outline by using the keyword
.B outline
followed by a color.  A single-color drop shadow is also available
using the keyword
.B shadow
followed by an optional corner specifier
.BR "" "(" bottom_right " being the default)"
and a color.  For a 3-D embossed look, use
.BI emboss " dark_color"
.IR light_color .
The opposite effect, a carved-out look, can be obtained with
.BI carved " dark_color"
.IR light_color .
(Of course, with those last two, the 3-D look will only work if you
choose the light and dark colors wisely.)

Finally, for no font effects at all, simply specify the keyword
.BR none .

The default value is
.B bottom_right black
which yields a black drop shadow, greatly improving the visibility of
lightly-colored fonts on top of light spots in a background image.
Note that font effects are not active in solid color mode.

IMAGECLASSES CONTEXT

This context contains global image attributes.  It also provides the

.RS 5
.BI icon " filename"
.RS 5
Use
.I filename
as the icon image for the Eterm window.
.I filename
can be an absolute path, relative to the current theme, or relative to
one of the directories in the

.RE

.BI anim " interval" "" " images ..."
.RS 5
Specifies an animation list to be use in cycling the background pixmap.  The

defines the delay, in seconds, between updates of the background.
This should be set to a reasonable value to insure that Eterm doesn't
spend all its time rendering backgrounds.  All the

IMAGE CONTEXT

This context defines all the attributes of a particular image.  There
can be (and usually are) several image contexts per theme, one for
each class of image.

.RS 5
.BI type " class"
.RS 5
Specifies the type, or
.IR class ","
of the image that is going to be defined in that context.  This MUST be the
first attribute defined in the image context.  Valid classes are:
.BR background ", " trough ", " anchor ", "
.BR up_arrow ", " down_arrow ", " left_arrow ", "
.BR right_arrow ", " menu ", " menuitem ", "
.BR submenu ", " button ", and " buttonbar .
Note that the left and right arrows, while valid, don't do anything just

definition will be applied to that image class.
.RE
.RE

.RS 5
\fBmode\fR \fIinitial_mode\fR [ \fBallow\fR \fIallowed_modes\fR ]
.RS 5
Specifies the initial mode for this image class as well as the modes which
the image class is allowed to use.
.I initial_mode
is the mode that the image will have on startup (unless overridden by
command-line options.
.I allowed_modes
is a list of one or more modes.  The image will be prevented from switching
to any mode not listed in the
.B allow
section.  If the
.B allow
section is omitted entirely, the image will never be permitted to change
from the
.IR initial_mode "."
If no
.B mode
line is specified for an image class, the default is equivalent to
.BR "mode solid allow solid" "."
Valid mode names are
.BR image " (to use an image), " trans " (for transparency), " viewport " (for viewport mode), "
.BR auto " (for auto mode, which requires Enlightenment 0.16 or better), and " solid " (which is a solid color only)."
.RE
.RE

.RS 5
.BR state " { " normal " | " selected " |"
.BR clicked " | " disabled " } "
.RS 5
This sets the state of the image you are about to define.  Up until the next
.B state
attribute that is encountered (or until you change types), all attributes will
apply to that particular state of the image.  You should at minimum define the
.B normal
state of the image.  It will be used as the default if the attributes
for the other states are not specified.  However, each image state has
self-contained options.  Therefore, if you define multiple states for
an image class, you must define ALL attributes needed by that state.
The sample themes supplied with Eterm demonstrate how to define 1-,
2-, 3-, and 4-state images.

image file!  Note that you can also supply an image geometry string here by
adding an
.B @

.IB w x h + x + y : ops
where
.IR w " and " h

.IR x " and " y
are the horizontal/vertical alignment percentages, and

Specifies a color modifier to apply to the image.  The second keyword determines
whether the modifier will be applied to the image overall, the red values, the
green values, or the blue values.  Each of the three parameters is a number
greater than or equal to 0.  The numbers can be specified as decimal, octal (if
preceded by "0"), or hexadecimal (if preceded by "0x").  A value of 256 (0x100)
represents 100%, or "leave that value unchanged."  0 represents 0%, 512 (0x200)
is 200%, etc.  However, be aware that overflow can occur with excessively high

.IR param "."
.B string
specifies a string to be sent to Eterm for handling (escape codes, for example).
.B echo
specifies a string to be sent to the client program (for sending commands to a
shell, or keystrokes to an application like emacs or mutt).  If you use either
of these action types,
.I param
will be parsed for escape codes (\\a, C-, and the like) before being sent.
.B submenu
specifies a submenu which should be displayed when this item is
selected, and
.I param
is the title of the submenu to show.  The submenu must have already been

ACTION CONTEXT

Actions are key or mouse button bindings which activate certain

.RS 5
Binds a
.IR keysym " or a mouse " button
to an action.  The action syntax follows the keyword
.B to
and is identical to the syntax used for menus (see above).  There can be any
number of
.I modifiers
(so long as the combination is reasonable) but only one
.IR keysym " or " button "."
Valid
.I modifiers
are
.BR ctrl ", " shift ", " lock ", "
.BR mod1 " through " mod5 ", "
.BR alt ", " meta ", and " anymod " (which allows any modifier)."
If none are given, the keypress must not have modifier keys in use or the action
will not be triggered.  Use
.B anymod
to allow any arbitrary modifier key to be used.  The
.I keysym
can be given in text (case-sensitive) or as a hex number.
.IR button s
should be specified as
.BR button1 " through " button5 "."
Also note that
.BR alt " and " meta
will be equivalent to one or more of
.BR mod1 " through " mod5 ", "
as well as perhaps each other, based on your modifier settings.  You

This option is intended for use only with programs that support this special Eterm
mode.  Do not enable it unless you are executing a program which uses this mode.
.RE

.BI itrans " boolean"
.br
.BI immotile_trans " boolean"
.RS 5
Toggles the immotile transparency optimization for transparent Eterm
windows.  Note that this does NOT activate transparency; you must
still activate "trans" mode for the background image.  This option
should be used on transparent windows which are shaded or tinted and
which do not move around on the desktop much.  See the
.B "Mon Mar  6 21:11:13 PST 2000"
ChangeLog entry for a more detailed explanation.
.RE

.BI buttonbar " boolean"
.RS 5
Toggle the display of all buttonbars.
.RE

.BI resize_gravity " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will automatically detect the nearest corner, and
font-change resizes will cause the Eterm window to gravitate toward
that corner.
.RE

.BI overstrike_bold " boolean"
.RS 5
If true (default), Eterm will simulate a bold font by printing each
character twice, offsetting the second pass by one pixel.  This makes
the characters seem thicker without the need for a special font.  You
may wish to disable this if you use a specific color for bold.
.RE

.BI bold_brightens_foreground " boolean"
.RS 5
If true (default), Eterm will use the "bold" ANSI color attribute to
brighten the foreground color by using the high-intensity colors (8
through 15) rather than the low-intensity colors (0 through 7).  Note
that having a specific color selected for bold will override this.
.RE

.BI blink_brightens_background " boolean"
.RS 5
If true (default), Eterm will use the "blink" ANSI color attribute to
brighten the background color by using the high-intensity colors (8
through 15) rather than the low-intensity colors (0 through 7).
.RE

.BI colors_suppress_bold " boolean"
.RS 5
If true (default), any colored text (that is, any text not rendered
using the default foreground color) will not be given any other

BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

Eterm has a set of built-in functions which are available in config
files.  Each one accepts zero or more parameters and outputs a series
of zero or more words.  "Words" are defined in shell terms; i.e.,
words are separated by whitespace, and single or double quotes can be
used to encapsulate words which contain whitespace themselves.  You
also employ backquotes to execute a command whose output can become
part of the config file itself or can be passed to a built-in function
as its parameter list.  Built-in functions and backquotes may be used
anywhere their output would be valid.  Built-in functions are prefixed
with the
.B %
character.

.RS 5
.BI %appname()
.RS 5
Returns the application name, a hyphen, and the version number.  Currently this
is the string 
.BR Eterm-@VERSION@ .
.RE

.BI %exec( command )
.RS 5
Executes
.I command
and returns the result.  Basically it's exactly like using backquotes.
.RE

.BI %get( variable )
.RS 5

.B %put()
function below.
.RE

.BI %put( "variable value" )
.RS 5
Create a config variable named
.I variable
and assign it the value of
.IR value .
The value can then subsequently be retrieved using
.BI %get( variable )
.RE

.BI %random( params )
.RS 5
This function randomly chooses one of the words which compose
.I params
and returns that.  The default themes that come with Eterm use this
function to choose random backgrounds, but backgrounds aren't the only
things that can be randomized with this function.  You can randomize
anything...colors, toggles, fonts, tinting, etc.
.RE

.BI %version()
.RS 5
Returns the version number.  Currently this
is the string 
.BR @VERSION@ .
.RE
.RE

.TP
PREPROCESSING

Eterm supports the
.BI %include " file"
directive to allow for separation of the configuration information into
multiple files.  Eterm will load and parse
.I file
just like any other config file, but will treat its contents as if
they replaced the directive itself.

You may also request that the config file be run through an external
preprocessor (such as m4 or cpp) before Eterm reads it.  This is done
via the
.BI %preproc " command"
directive.  You may specify anything you like for
.I command
so long as it accepts input on STDIN and sends output to STDOUT.  See
the
.B menus.cfg
file in the default
.B chooser
theme for an example.

.TP
SCRIPT FUNCTIONS

One of the action types which can be bound to keypresses, mouse
buttons, menuitems, or buttonbar buttons is a
.BR script .
The script must be a single word (i.e., containing no spaces or
enclosed in quotes) and consists of one or more calls to the script
functions below.  Each call is separated from the next by a semicolon
.BR "" ( ; ).
Function parameters are enclosed in parentheses; the parentheses are
optional if no parameters are to be passed.  Commas and/or whitespace
separate parameters from each other.

.RS 5
.BI copy( buffer )
.RS 5
Copies the current selection to the specified clipboard or cut buffer.
.I buffer
is either a number
.BR 0 - 7 ,
in which case the selection is copied to the cut buffer specified, or
one of the words

.RE

.SH ESCREEN
Escreen is a screen/twin interface layer which allows Eterm to
interoperate with GNU
.B screen
and with Massimiliano Ghilardi's
.B twin
software.  This allows Eterm to support multiple subshell sessions
within a single window.  On the surface, this feature works similarly
to the "tabbed" sessions offered by programs like
.BR konsole " and " multi-gnome-terminal .
However, Escreen has the advantage of being an interface to existing
software, thus providing additional capabilities like multiple regions
per display, detach/reattach capability, seamless remote session
support, firewall support, and more.

Escreen support is still somewhat experimental and is thus not
compiled into Eterm by default.  To enable it, you must compile with
.BR --enable-escreen " and/or " --enable-etwin
(depending on whether you have screen, twin, or both).  If you
installed from a package, you can use
.B Eterm --version
and check for either
.BR "+ESCREEN" " (enabled) or " "-ESCREEN" " (disabled)."

For best results, if you wish to use Escreen mode, do so by invoking
Eterm with the Escreen theme
.BR "" "(" "Eterm -t Escreen" ")."
This theme supplies default key bindings, the basic Escreen menu,
color definitions, etc. for use by the Escreen engine.  Most
importantly, it supplies the required
.B url
parameter in order to invoke Escreen mode.

Consult the README.Escreen file for more in-depth discussion of
Escreen mode.
