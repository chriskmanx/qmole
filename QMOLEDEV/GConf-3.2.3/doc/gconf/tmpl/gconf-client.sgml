<para>
#GConfClient adds the following features to plain GConf:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
A client-side cache for a specified list of directories you're interested in.
You can "preload" entire directories into the cache, speeding things up even more.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Some automatic error handling, if you request it.
</para>

<para>
Signals when a value changes or an error occurs.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<warning>
<para>
If you use #GConfClient, you should not use the underlying #GConfEngine
directly, or you'll break things. This is why there's no
gconf_client_get_engine() function; in fact, if you create the #GConfClient with
gconf_client_get_default(), there is no (legitimate) way to obtain a pointer to the
underlying #GConfEngine. If you create a #GConfClient from an existing engine,
you'll have to be disciplined enough to avoid using that engine directly.
<footnote>
<para>
This is all a white lie; <emphasis>some</emphasis> direct #GConfEngine
operations are safe. But it's complicated to know which, and if an operation
isn't safe the resulting bugs will mangle the cache and cause weird bugs at an
indeterminate time in the future; you don't want to risk this
situation.
</para>
</footnote>
</para>
</warning>

<para>
A #GConfClient has a list of directories that it "watches." These directories
are optionally pre-loaded into the cache, and monitored in order to emit the
#value_changed signal. The #GConfClient can also be used to access directories
not in the list, but those directories won't be preloaded and the "value_changed"
signal won't be emitted for them.
</para>

<para>
There are two error-related signals in #GConfClient. The first is plain "error";
it's emitted anytime an error occurs. The second is "unreturned_error"; this
signal is emitted if you pass <symbol>NULL</symbol> as the #GError** to any
#GConfClient function. The idea is that you can have a global error handler
attached to the "unreturned_error" signal; if you want to use this handler, you
don't need to use the normal GConf error handling mechanism. However, if you
ever need to handle errors for a specific function call, you can override the
global handler by passing a non-<symbol>NULL</symbol> #GError** to the
function.  If you want an error handler that's <emphasis>always</emphasis>
invoked, use the "error" signal.
</para>

<para>
The "value_changed" signal is emitted whenever the server notifies your client
program that a value has changed in the GConf database. There's one problem with
this signal: the signal handler has to use strcmp() to determine whether the
changed value is the one it was interested in. If you are interested in lots of
values, then every time a value changes you'll be making lots of calls to
strcmp() and getting O(n) performance. gconf_client_notify_add() is a superior
interface in most cases for this reason. Note that calling gconf_client_set()
and its relatives will cause "value_changed" to be emitted, but "value_changed"
is also emitted if another process changes the value.
</para>

<para>
Most of the #GConfClient interface mirrors the functions you'd use to manipulate
a #GConfEngine (gconf_engine_get () and gconf_client_get(), for example). These should
all work just like the #GConfEngine versions, except that they use the cache
from #GConfClient and emit the #GConfClient signals.
</para>

<para>
As always with GConf, applications based on #GConfClient should use a
model-controller-view architecture. Typically, this means that areas of your
application affected by a setting will monitor the relevant key and update
themselves when necessary. The preferences dialog will simply change keys,
allowing GConf to notify the rest of the application that changes have occurred.
Here the application proper is the "view," GConf is the "model", and the
preferences dialog is the "controller." In no case should you do this:
<programlisting>
 gconf_client_set(client, key, value);
 application_update_to_reflect_setting();
</programlisting>
This breaks if a setting is changed <emphasis>outside</emphasis> your
application&mdash;or even from a different part of your application.
The correct way (in pseudo-code) is:
<programlisting>
 /* At application startup */
 gconf_client_notify_add(client, key, application_update_to_reflect_setting, data);

 /* From preferences dialog */
 gconf_client_set(client, key, value);
</programlisting>
See the example programs that come with GConf for more details.

<!-- ##### ENUM GConfClientPreloadType ##### -->
<para>
The #GConfClientPreloadType is used to tell #GConfClient how to preload one of
its directories. As a rule of thumb, if you plan to get the value of almost all the
keys in a directory, preloading that directory will probably enhance
performance. If you plan to use only half the keys, preloading is likely a bad
idea. @GCONF_CLIENT_PRELOAD_NONE specifies that no preload occurs,
@GCONF_CLIENT_PRELOAD_ONELEVEL loads the immediate children of the directory,
@GCONF_CLIENT_PRELOAD_RECURSIVE loads <emphasis>all</emphasis> children of the
directory and its subdirectories, recursively.
</para>

@GCONF_CLIENT_PRELOAD_NONE: preload nothing.
@GCONF_CLIENT_PRELOAD_ONELEVEL: preload immediate children of the directory.
@GCONF_CLIENT_PRELOAD_RECURSIVE: recursively preload everything in and below the directory.

<!-- ##### ENUM GConfClientErrorHandlingMode ##### -->
<para>
#GConfClientErrorHandlingMode is used to control #GConfClient's default error
handling.  #GConfClient can pop up a dialog in the default signal handler for
"error" or "unreturned_error." You can specify that no errors are handled, only
unreturned errors are handled, or all errors are handled with this enumeration.
You can prevent specific errors from being handled automatically by stopping the
signal emission before the default signal handler is called (see the GLib
documentation, g_signal_stop_emission_by_name() for example).
</para>

@GCONF_CLIENT_HANDLE_NONE: never run a default error handler.
@GCONF_CLIENT_HANDLE_UNRETURNED: run a default error handler for unreturned errors ("unreturned_error" signal).
@GCONF_CLIENT_HANDLE_ALL: run a default error handler for all errors ("error" signal).

<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GConfClientNotifyFunc ##### -->
<para>
This is the signature of a user function added with gconf_client_notify_add().
The notify function is invoked when the value of a key changes. The @entry
argument holds the new value, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> if the key was unset. The
value in the @entry argument should not be modified, and should be copied if you
want to keep it around (the #GConfClient will destroy it sometime after your
notify function is called).
</para>

@client: the #GConfClient notifying us.
@cnxn_id: connection ID from gconf_client_notify_add().
@entry: a #GConfEntry.
@user_data: user data from gconf_client_notify_add().


<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GConfClientErrorHandlerFunc ##### -->
<para>
This is the signature of a user function which needs to be called for error 
handling.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@error: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.


<!-- ##### MACRO GCONF_CLIENT ##### -->
<para>
Casts a pointer to a #GConfClient*.
</para>

@obj: a #GConfClient.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_default ##### -->
<para>

</para>

@void: 
@Returns: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_for_engine ##### -->
<para>

</para>

@engine: 
@Returns: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_add_dir ##### -->
<para>
Add a directory to the list of directories the #GConfClient will watch. Any
changes to keys below this directory will cause the "value_changed" signal to be
emitted.  When you add the directory, you can request that the #GConfClient
preload its contents; see #GConfClientPreloadType for details.
</para>

<para>
Added directories may not overlap. That is, if you add "/foo", you may not add
"/foo/bar". However you can add "/foo" and "/bar". You can also add "/foo"
multiple times; if you add a directory multiple times, it will not be removed
until you call gconf_client_remove_dir() an equal number of times. The directory
name must not have a trailing slash.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@dir: directory to add to the list.
@preload: degree of preload.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_remove_dir ##### -->
<para>
Remove a directory from the list created with gconf_client_add_dir().  If any
notifications have been added below this directory with
gconf_client_notify_add(), those notifications will be disabled until you re-add
the removed directory.  Note that if a directory has been added multiple times,
you must remove it the same number of times before the remove takes effect.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@dir: directory to remove.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_notify_add ##### -->
<para>
Request notification of changes to @namespace_section. This includes the key
@namespace_section itself, and any keys below it (the behavior is identical to
gconf_engine_notify_add(), but while gconf_engine_notify_add() places a notification request
on the server for every notify function, #GConfClient requests server
notification for directories added with gconf_client_add_dir() and keeps the
list of #GConfClientNotifyFunc on the client side). 
</para>

<para>
For the notification to happen, @namespace_section must be equal to or below one
of the directories added with gconf_client_add_dir(). You can still call
gconf_client_notify_add() for other directories, but no notification will be
received until you add a directory above or equal to @namespace_section.  One
implication of this is that gconf_client_remove_dir() temporarily disables
notifications that were below the removed directory.
</para>

<para>
The function returns a connection ID you can use to call
gconf_client_notify_remove().
</para>

<para>

@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: a connection ID for removing the notification.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_notify_remove ##### -->

@key: the key that has changed.
@Since: 2.4.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_set_error_handling ##### -->
<para>
Controls the default error handling for #GConfClient. See
#GConfClientErrorHandlingMode and #GConfClientParentWindowFunc for details on this.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@mode: error handling mode.
<!-- # Unused Parameters # -->
@func: function to retrieve the parent window for error dialogs.
@user_data: user data to pass to @func.

@func: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_clear_cache ##### -->
<para>
Dumps everything out of the #GConfClient client-side cache. If you know you're
done using the #GConfClient for a while, you can call this function to save some
memory.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_preload ##### -->
<para>
Preloads a directory. Normally you do this when you call gconf_client_add_dir(),
but if you've called gconf_client_clear_cache() there may be a reason to do it
again.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@dirname: directory to preload.
@type: degree of preload.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_set ##### -->
<para>
Sets the value of a configuration key. Just like gconf_engine_set (), but uses
#GConfClient caching and error-handling features. The @val argument will not be
modified.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key to set.
@val: new value.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get ##### -->
<para>
Gets the value of a configuration key. Just like gconf_engine_get (), but uses
#GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key to get.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: newly-allocated #GConfValue, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> if unset and no default exists.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_without_default ##### -->
<para>
Gets the value of a configuration key. Just like gconf_client_get () but doesn't look for a default value if the key is unset.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key to get.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: newly-allocated #GConfValue, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> if unset (even if a default exists).


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_entry ##### -->
<para>
Obtains the full #GConfEntry for a value. Just like gconf_engine_get_entry (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key:  key to get.
@locale: preferred locale (as in the locale-related environment variables).
@use_schema_default: indicates whether to look for a default value when the key is unset.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: a #GConfEntry.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_default_from_schema ##### -->
<para>
Returns the default value stored in the key's schema, if the key has a schema
associated and the schema exists and the schema contains a default value.  Note
that gconf_client_get (), gconf_engine_client_string(), and so on already return the default value
if no other value is found, so normally you do not need this function. This
function is just for convenience; you could also get the #GConfMetaInfo for the
key, read the schema name from there, then look up the schema by name and
extract the default value. Just like gconf_engine_get_default_from_schema (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key to get.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: newly-allocated #GConfValue, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> if the key has no default value in its schema.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_unset ##### -->
<para>
Unsets the value of @key; if @key is already unset, has no effect.  An
error of note is %GCONF_OVERRIDDEN, indicating that the system
administrator has "forced" a value for this key. 
Just like gconf_engine_unset (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key to unset.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> on error.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_recursive_unset ##### -->
<para>
Unsets all keys below @key, including @key itself.  If any unset fails, continues on to unset 
as much as it can. The first failure is returned in @err. Just like gconf_engine_recursive_unset (), 
but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: a key or directory name to be unset.
@flags: change how the unset is done.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.

@Returns: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_suggest_sync ##### -->
<para>
Suggests to <application>gconfd</application> that you've just finished
a block of changes, and it would be an optimal time to sync to
permanent storage. This is only a suggestion; and
<application>gconfd</application> will eventually sync even if you
don't call gconf_engine_suggest_sync(). This function is just a "hint"
provided to <application>gconfd</application> to maximize efficiency
and minimize data loss.
Just like gconf_engine_suggest_sync ().
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_dir_exists ##### -->
<para>
Queries whether the directory @dir exists in the GConf
database. Returns <symbol>TRUE</symbol> or <symbol>FALSE</symbol>.
Just like gconf_engine_dir_exists (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@dir: directory to check for
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> or <symbol>FALSE</symbol>.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_key_is_writable ##### -->
<para>
Checks whether the key is writable.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: the value to be changed.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> if the key is writable, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> if the key is read only.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_float ##### -->
<para>
Requests the floating point number (%GCONF_VALUE_FLOAT) stored at
@key. Automatically performs type-checking, so if a non-float is
stored at @key, an error is returned. On error, or if @key is unset, 
0.0 is returned.
Just like gconf_engine_get_float (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want the value of.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: the value of @key, or 0.0 if no value is obtained.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_int ##### -->
<para>
Requests the integer (%GCONF_VALUE_INT) stored at
@key. Automatically performs type-checking, so if a non-integer is
stored at @key, an error is returned. On error, or if @key is unset, 
0 is returned.
Just like gconf_engine_get_int (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want the value of.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: the value of @key, or 0 if no value is obtained.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_string ##### -->
<para>
Requests the string (%GCONF_VALUE_STRING) stored at
@key. Automatically performs type-checking, so if a non-string is
stored at @key, an error is returned. On error, or if @key is unset, 
<symbol>NULL</symbol> is returned.
Just like gconf_engine_get_string (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want the value of.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: allocated string (value of @key), or <symbol>NULL</symbol> if no value is obtained.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_bool ##### -->
<para>
Requests the boolean value (%GCONF_VALUE_BOOL) stored at
@key. Automatically performs type-checking, so if a non-bool is
stored at @key, an error is returned. On error, or if @key is unset, 
<symbol>FALSE</symbol> is returned.
Just like gconf_engine_get_bool (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want the value of.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: the value of @key, or <symbol>FALSE</symbol> if no value is obtained.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_schema ##### -->
<para>
Requests the schema (%GCONF_VALUE_SCHEMA) stored at @key.
Automatically performs type-checking, so if a non-schema is stored at
@key, an error is returned. If no value is set or an error occurs,
<symbol>NULL</symbol> is returned.
Just like gconf_engine_get_schema (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want the value of.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: the value of @key as an allocated #GConfSchema, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> if no value was obtained.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_list ##### -->
<para>

</para>

@client: 
@key: 
@list_type: 
@err: 
@Returns: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_get_pair ##### -->
<para>
Requests the pair (%GCONF_VALUE_PAIR) stored at @key.  Automatically
performs type-checking, so if a non-pair is stored at @key, or the
pair does not have the right @car_type and @cdr_type, an error is
returned. Remember that the <firstterm>car</firstterm> of a pair is
its first value, and the <firstterm>cdr</firstterm> is its second
value, in the Lisp tradition. 
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Remember that GConf pairs can only store primitive types:
%GCONF_VALUE_FLOAT, %GCONF_VALUE_INT, %GCONF_VALUE_BOOL,
%GCONF_VALUE_STRING, %GCONF_VALUE_SCHEMA.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
gconf_client_get_pair() stores the two fields of the pair in the locations
pointed to by @car_retloc and @cdr_retloc. The type of these pointers
depends on the corresponding @car_type and @cdr_type:
 
<informaltable pgwide="1" frame="none">
<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colwidth="2*"/><colspec colwidth="8*"/>
<tbody>

<row>

</row>

</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

In the %GCONF_VALUE_STRING case, you must g_free() the string(s)
stored in the return location(s). In the %GCONF_VALUE_SCHEMA case you
must gconf_schema_free() the returned schema. If there's an error
or the value is unset, @car_retloc and @cdr_retloc are left unchanged.
</para>

gconf_client_get_pair() returns <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success.

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_set_bool ##### -->
<para>
Change the value of @key to @val. Automatically creates the @key if it didn't exist before (ie it was unset or it only had a default value). If the key already exists but but doesn't store a boolean (GCONF_VALUE_BOOL), gconf_client_set_bool() will fail.
Just like gconf_engine_set (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want to set the value of.
@val: new value of @key.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> on error.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_set_schema ##### -->
<para>
Change the value of @key to @val. Automatically creates the @key if it didn't exist before (ie it was unset or it only had a default value). If the key already exists but doesn't store a schema value (GCONF_VALUE_SCHEMA), gconf_client_set_schema() will fail.
Just like gconf_engine_set (), but uses #GConfClient caching and error-handling features.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want to set the value of.
@val: new value of @key.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> on error.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_set_list ##### -->
<para>
Changes the value of @key to a @list of type @list_type. Automatically creates the @key if it didn't exist before 
(ie it was unset or it had a default value). If the key already exists but doesn't store a list value 
(GCONF_VALUE_LIST), gconf_client_set_list() will fail.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want to set the value of.
@list_type: type of each list element.
@list: new value of @key.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> on error.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_set_pair ##### -->
<para>
Changes the value of @key to a pair with the first field of type @car_type and the second field of type @cdr_type. 
Automatically creates the key if it didn't exist before (ie it was unset or it had a default value). If the key 
already exists but doesn't store a pair value (GCONF_VALUE_PAIR), gconf_client_set_pair() will fail.

</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key you want to set the value of.
@car_type: type of the pair's first field (car).
@cdr_type: type of the pair's second field (cdr).
@address_of_car: address of the car.
@address_of_cdr: address of the cdr.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> on error.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_error ##### -->
<para>
Emits the "error" signal. Rarely useful.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@error: error to pass to signal handlers.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_unreturned_error ##### -->
<para>
Emits the "unreturned_error" signal. Rarely useful.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@error: error to pass to signal handlers.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_value_changed ##### -->
<para>
Emits the "value_changed" signal. Rarely useful.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@key: key to pass to signal handlers.
@value: value of @key to pass to signal handlers.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_commit_change_set ##### -->
<para>
Applies the changes in the change set to the #GConfClient passed as
the first argument. If @remove_committed is <symbol>TRUE</symbol>,
then any successfully-committed changes are removed from the change
set. If @remove_committed is <symbol>FALSE</symbol>, the
#GConfChangeSet is left unmodified.
</para>

<para>
If any set or unset operation results in an error, then processing
terminates and the error is returned in @err (unless @err was
<symbol>NULL</symbol>). If @remove_committed was
<symbol>TRUE</symbol>, then all the changes committed before the error
occurred will have been removed from the set. If any error occurs,
<symbol>FALSE</symbol> is returned.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@cs: a #GConfChangeSet.
@remove_committed: whether to remove successfully-committed changes from the set.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: <symbol>TRUE</symbol> on success, <symbol>FALSE</symbol> if an error occurs.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_reverse_change_set ##### -->
<para>
Creates a change set that would reverse @cs. That is, for each change in @cs,
save the current state of that key in the returned change set.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@cs: change set to create the reverse of.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: a new change set that would restore the current state of each key in @cs.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_change_set_from_currentv ##### -->
<para>
Creates a change set that will change the keys in
<symbol>NULL</symbol>-terminated array @keys to their current state. Use this to
save the current state of a collection of keys; then you can later revert to the
current state by committing the returned change set.
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@keys: <symbol>NULL</symbol>-terminated array of key names.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: new change set that changes all the @keys to their current state.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_client_change_set_from_current ##### -->
<para>
Convenient varargs version of gconf_client_change_set_from_currentv().
</para>

@client: a #GConfClient.
@err: the return location for an allocated #GError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@first_key: first key to save the current state of.
@...: 
@Returns: new change set that changes all the keys to their current state.
<!-- # Unused Parameters # -->
@Varargs: <symbol>NULL</symbol>-terminated list of additional keys.
