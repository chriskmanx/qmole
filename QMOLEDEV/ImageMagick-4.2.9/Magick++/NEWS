(0.8.6)
  * Color is now based on ImageMagick's RunlengthPacket structure (via a
    pointer) so that it may eventually be used to represent an image
    pixel.  This is currently a work in progress.
(0.8.5)
  * Headers are now installed under prefix/include/Magick++ on Unix
    systems with the exception that Magick++.h is installed under
    prefix/include as it was before.  Programs which include Magick++.h
    (the documented approach) should not be impacted.
  * Image constructors to construct an image from a BLOB.
  * Image read and write methods to decode and encode images stored in a
    BLOB.  This allows reading/writing image "files" from/to memory rather
    than a traditional file.
(0.8.4)
  * New mapImages algorithm maps a sequence of images to the colormap of
    a provided image.
  * New quantizeImages algorithm computes and applies a common colormap
    to a sequence of images.
(0.8.3)
  * Ported to ImageMagick 4.2.6.
  * Blob supports default constructor.
  * New Blob method updateNoCopy() to support efficient initialization by
    derived class.
(0.8.2)
  * Uses libtool 1.3 to build library under Unix and Cygwin (static lib only).
  * Added Blob class to support supplying formatted binary data to methods.
  * Added support for setting ICC and IPTC profiles from a binary BLOB.
  * Added support for transformations of image data to/from alternate
    colorspace (e.g. CYMK).
  * Added support for 'pinging' an image (get image dimensions/size quickly).
  * Added 'uncondense' method to de-compress in-memory image data.
  * Added support for annotation using rotated text.
(0.8.1)
  * Added support for setting alpha in Magick::Color
  * Set/get color alpha in Magick::Image::pixelColor() for DirectClass images.
(0.8)
  * Transitioned to Beta
  * Improved Microsoft Visual C++ build environment.
(0.7.4)
  * Added animateImages() and displayImages() to MagickSTL.h.
  * Added function objects to support setting image attributes.
(0.7.3)
  * Image::penTexture() now takes Image reference rather than
    Image pointer.  Set Image to invalid using isValid(false)
    to unset texture.
  * Attribute methods that take Color, Geometry, Image, or string
    arguments may now unset the attribute by setting the state of
    the object to invalid using isValid(false), or the empty string
    (in the case of string).  This allows full control over ImageMagick
    attributes which are stored as C strings which may be set to NULL.
  * Updated for ImageMagick 4.2.1
(0.7.2)
  * Added STL function object support for all Image manipulation
    methods to support operating on all or part of the images
    stored in an STL container.
(0.7.1)
  * Added Coordinate class and methods in Drawable to support x,y
    coordinates.
  * Changed coordinate parameters from unsigned int to double in Drawable.
  * Changed polygon methods in Drawable to use STL list argument.
  * Added STL list based draw method to Image.
  * Changed Exception heirarchy to support Warning and Error sub-classes.
    Most exception class names have changed.
(0.7)
  * Updated for ImageMagick 4.2.0
  * Added support for flood-filling and drawing with texture.
  * Montage supported.
  * Oodles of bugs fixed.
  * Implemented image attribute tests.
  * Implemented PerlMagick 'demo' and 'shapes' demo programs in Magick++.
  * Some parameters re-ordered due to experience from writing demo programs.
(0.6)
  * Initial support for integrating image-list oriented operations with
    STL containers.
(0.5):
  * Compiles and runs under Unix using egcs release 1.1 or later.
  * Compiles and runs under Windows using Visual C++ 5.X or later.
  * Users of Magick++ API are not exposed to ImageMagick headers.
  * Magick++ API is namespaced under "Magick".
  * "Magick" prefix removed from object names.
  * User options are now completely contained within Image object.
    There is no longer a MagickOptions parameter to some methods.
(0.1):
  * All ImageMagick operations which operate on individual images are
    supported.
  * Image objects have value semantics, avoid unnecessary image
    copies through the use of reference counting, and may be compared
    via standard operators.
  * Geometry, color, annotations, and user-options are supported by
    separate classes.
  * Errors are reported synchronously via C++ exceptions.
