<p>Magick++ provides a simple C++ API to the ImageMagick image processing
library which supports reading and writing a huge number of image formats
as well as supporting a broad spectrum of traditional image processing
operations. The ImageMagick C API is complex and the data structures are
currently not documented. Magick++ provides access to most of the features
available from the C API but in a simple object-oriented and well-documented
framework.
<p>Magick++ is intended to support commercial-grade application development.
In order to avoid possible conflicts with the user's application, all symbols
contained in Magick++ (included by the header <tt>&lt;Magick++.h></tt>)
are scoped to the namespace <i>Magick</i>. Symbols from the ImageMagick
C library are imported under the <i>MagickLib</i> namespace to avoid possible
conflicts and ImageMagick macros are only included within the Magick++
implementation so they won't impact the user's application.
<p>The core class in Magick++ is the <a href="Image.html">Image</a> class.
The Image class provides methods to manipulate a single image frame (e.g.
a JPEG image). Standard Template Library (STL) compatable <a href="STL.html">algorithms
and function objects</a> are provided in order to manipulate multiple image
frames or to read and write file formats which support multiple image frames
(e.g. GIF animations, MPEG animations, and Postscript files).
<p>The Image class supports reference-counted memory management which supports
the semantics of an intrinsic variable type (e.g. 'int') with an extremely
efficient <tt>operator = </tt>and copy constructor (only a pointer is assigned)
while ensuring that the image data is replicated as required so that it
the image may be modified without impacting earlier generations. Since
the Image class manages heap memory internally, images are best allocated
via C++ automatic (stack-based) memory allocation. This support allows
most programs using Magick++ to be written without using any pointers,
simplifying the implementation and avoiding the risks of using pointers.
<p>The image class uses a number of supportive classes in order to specify
arguments. Colors are specified via the <a href="Color.html">Color</a>
class. Colors specified in X11-style string form are implicitly converted
to the Color class. Geometry arguments (those specifying width, height,
and/or x and y offset) are specified via the <a href="Geometry.html">Geometry</a>
class.&nbsp; Similar to the Color class, geometries specified as an X11-style
string are implicitly converted to the Geometry class. Two dimensional
drawable objects are specified via the <a href="Drawable.html">Drawable</a>
class. Drawable objects may be provided as a single object or as a list
of objects to be rendered using the current image options. Montage options
(a montage is a rendered grid of thumbnails in one image) are specified
via the <a href="Montage.html">Montage</a> class.
<p>Errors are reported using C++ exceptions derived from the <a href="Exception.html">Exception</a>
class, which is itself derived from the standard C++ exception class. Exceptions
are reported synchronous with the operation and are caught by the first
matching <i>try</i> block as the stack is unraveled. This allows a clean
coding style in which multiple related Magick++ commands may be executed
with errors handled as a unit rather than line-by-line. Since the Image
object provides reference-counted memory management, unreferenced images
on the stack are automatically cleaned up, avoiding the potential for memory
leaks.
<p>For ease of access, the documentation for the available user-level classes
is available via the following table.
