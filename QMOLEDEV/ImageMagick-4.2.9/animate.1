.SH NAME
animate - display a sequence of images on any workstation running X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "animate" [ \fIoptions\fP ...] \fIfile\fP
[ [ \fIoptions\fP ...] \fIfile\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBanimate\fP displays a sequence of images on any workstation display
running an X server.  \fBanimate\fP first determines the hardware
capabilities of the workstation.  If the number of unique colors in an
image is less than or equal to the number the workstation can support,
the image is displayed in an X window.  Otherwise the number of colors
in the image is first reduced to match the color resolution of the
workstation before it is displayed.

This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel image can display on a
8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device.  In most instances the
reduced color image closely resembles the original.  Alternatively, a
monochrome or pseudo-color image sequence can display on a continuous-tone
24 bits-per-pixel device.

To help prevent color flashing on X server visuals that have colormaps,
\fBanimate\fP creates a single colormap from the image sequence.  This can
be rather time consuming.  You can speed this operation up by reducing
the colors in the image before you `animate' them.  Use \fBmogrify\fP
to color reduce the images to a single colormap.  See \fBmogrify(1)\fP for
details.  Alternatively, you can use a \fIStandard Colormap\fP; or a static,
direct, or true color visual.  You can define a \fIStandard Colormap\fP with
\fIxstdcmap\fP.  See \fBXSTDCMAP(1)\fP for details.  This method is recommended
for colormapped X server because it eliminates the need to compute a global
colormap.
.SH EXAMPLES
To animate a set of images of a cockatoo, use:

.nf
     animate cockatoo.*
.fi

To animate a cockatoo image sequence while using the \fIStandard Colormap\fP
"best", use:

.nf
     xstdcmap -best
     animate -map best cockatoo.*
.fi

To animate an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a
backdrop, use:

.nf
     animate +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.*
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-backdrop"
display the image centered on a backdrop.

This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for
hiding other X window activity while viewing the image sequence.   The color
of the backdrop is specified as the background color.  Refer to \fBX
RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-colormap \fItype\fP"
the type of colormap: \fBShared\fP or \fBPrivate\fP.

This option only applies when the default X server visual is
\fIPseudoColor\fP or \fIGrayScale\fP.  Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more
details.  By default, a shared colormap is allocated.  The image shares
colors with other X clients.  Some image colors could be approximated,
therefore your image may look very different than intended.  Choose
\fBPrivate\fP and the image colors appear exactly as they are
defined.  However, other clients may go "technicolor" when the image
colormap is installed.
.TP
.B "-colors \fIvalue\fP"
preferred number of colors in the image.

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more.  Note, this is a color reduction option.  Images with
less unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate
or unused colors removed.
Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for more details.

Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP affect
the color reduction algorithm.
.TP
.B "-colorspace \fIvalue\fP"
the type of colorspace: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP, \fBXYZ\fP, \fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP,
\fBYUV\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.

Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space.
Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV
or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more closely
than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give better
results when color reducing an image.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for
more details.

The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.
.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}\fP"
preferred size and location of the cropped image.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  For example
to crop the image by ten percent on all sides of the image, use \fB-crop 10%\fP.

Use cropping to apply image processing options, or display, only a
particular area of an image.  

Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.   Use \fB-crop
0x0\fP to trim edges that are the background color.  Add an x and y offset
to leave a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.

The equivalent X resource for this option is \fBcropGeometry\fP
(class \fBCropGeometry\fP).  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>x<seconds>\fP"
display the next image after pausing.

This option is useful for regulating the display of the sequence of
images.  \fI1/100ths of a second\fP must expire before the display of
the next image.  The default is 6/100 of a second between each frame
of the image sequence.  The second value is optional.  It specifies the
number of \fIseconds\fP to pause before repeating your animation
sequence.
.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>\fP
vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image.

This option specifies an image density when decoding a Postscript or Portable
Document page.  The default is 72 pixels per inch in the horizontal and
vertical direction.
.TP
.B "-display \fIhost:display[.screen]\fP"
specifies the X server to contact; see \fBX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-dither"
apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image.

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for
spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring
pixels.  Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors
can be improved with this option.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

Use \fB+dither\fP to render Postscript without text or graphic aliasing.
.TP
.B "-gamma \fIvalue\fP"
level of gamma correction.

The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look
different due to differences in the display monitor.  Use gamma
correction to adjust for this color difference.  Reasonable values
extend from 0.8 to 2.3.

You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue
channels of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes
(i.e. 1.7/2.3/1.2).

Use \fB+gamma\fP to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels.  This option is useful if the image is of a known
gamma but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).
.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}{!}{<}{>}\fP"
preferred size and location of the Image window.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.  By default, the window size is the image
size and the location is chosen by you when it is mapped.

By default, the width and height are maximum values.  That is, the
image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while
maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.  Append an exclamation point
to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you
specify.  For example, if you specify \fB640x480!\fP the image width is
set to 640 pixels and height to 480.  If only one factor is
specified, both the width and height assume the value.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  The
image size is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain
the final image dimensions.  To increase the size of an image, use a
value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%).  To decrease an image's size, use a
percentage less than 100.

Use \fB>\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP
if its size exceeds the geometry specification.  \fB<>\fP resizes
the image \fIonly\fP if its dimensions is less than the geometry
specification.  For example, if you specify \fB640x480>\fP and the
image size is 512x512, the image size does not change.  However, if
the image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.

When displaying an image on an X server, \fI<x offset>\fP and
\fI<y offset>\fP is relative to the root window.

The equivalent X resource for this option is \fBgeometry\fP
(class \fBGeometry\fP).  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-interlace \fItype\fP"
the type of interlacing scheme: \fBNone\fP, \fBLine\fP, \fBPlane\fP, or
\fBPartition\fP.  The default is \fBNone\fP.

This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw
image formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP.  \fBNone\fP means do not
interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline
interlacing (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and \fBPlane\fP uses
plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).  \fBPartition\fP is like
plane except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g.
image.R, image.G, and image.B).

Use \fBLine\fP, or \fBPlane\fP to create an interlaced GIF or progressive
JPEG image.
.TP
.B "-map \fItype\fP"
display image using this \fIStandard Colormap\fP type.

Choose from these \fIStandard Colormap\fP types:

    best
    default
    gray
    red
    green
    blue

The \fIX server\fP must support the \fIStandard Colormap\fP you choose,
otherwise an error occurs.  Use \fBlist\fP as the type and \fBanimate(1)\fP
searches the list of colormap types in top-to-bottom order until one is
located. See \fBxstdcmap(1)\fP for one way of creating \fIStandard Colormaps\fP.
.TP
.B "-monochrome"
transform the image to black and white.
.TP
.B "-remote \fIstring\fP"
execute a command in an remote display process.

The only command recognized at this time is the name of an image file to
load.
.TP
.B "-rotate \fIdegrees{<}{>}\fP"
apply Paeth image rotation to the image.

Use \fB>\fP to rotate the image \fIonly\fP if its width exceeds the
height.  \fB<\fP rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than
the height.  For example, if you specify \fB-90>\fP and the image size
is 480x640, the image is not rotated by the specified angle.  However,
if the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.

Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with
the color defined as \fBbordercolor\fP (class \fBborderColor\fP).
.TP
.B "-scene \fIvalue{-value}\fP"
image scene number.

Use this option to specify an image sequence with a single filename. See
the discussion of \fIfile\fP below for details.
.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>{+offset}"
width and height of the image.

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose
dimensions are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP, \fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.
In addition to width and height, use \fB-size\fP to skip any header
information in the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP
image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).
.TP
.B "-title \fIstring\fP"
assign a title to the displayed image.

Use this option to assign a specific title to the image.  This is
assigned to the image window and is typically displayed in the window
title bar.  Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width,
height, or other image attributes by embedding special format characters:

.nf
    %b   file size
    %d   directory
    %e   filename extension
    %f   filename
    %h   height
    %m   magick
    %p   page number
    %s   scene number
    %t   top of filename
    %w   width
    %x   x resolution
    %y   y resolution
    \\n   newline
    \\r   carriage return
.fi

For example,

.nf
     -title "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image title of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image title is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.
.TP
.B "-treedepth \fIvalue\fP"
Normally, this integer value is zero or one.  A zero or one tells
\fBanimate\fP to choose a optimal tree depth for the color reduction
algorithm.

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of
memory.  However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images.
To assure the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this
parameter.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for more details.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.
.TP
.B -verbose
print detailed information about the image.

This information is printed: image scene number;  image name;  image
size; the image class (\fIDirectClass\fP or \fIPseudoClass\fP);  the total
number of unique colors;  and the number of seconds to read and
transform the image.  Refer to \fBmiff(5)\fP for a description of
the image class.

If \fB-colors\fP is also specified, the total unique colors in the image
and color reduction error values are printed.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP
for a description of these values.
.TP
.B "-visual \fItype\fP"
animate images using this visual type.

Choose from these visual classes:

.nf
    StaticGray
    GrayScale
    StaticColor
    PseudoColor
    TrueColor
    DirectColor
    default
    \fIvisual id\fP
.fi

The X server must support the visual you choose, otherwise an error occurs.
If a visual is not specified, the visual class that can display the most
simultaneous colors on the default screen is chosen.
.TP
.B "-window \fIid\fP"
set the background pixmap of this window to the image.

\fIid\fP can be a window id or name.  Specify \fBroot\fP to select X's root
window as the target window.

By default the image is tiled onto the background of the target
window.   If \fB-backdrop\fP or \fB-geometry\fP are specified, the
image is surrounded by the background color.  Refer to \fBX
RESOURCES\fP for details.

The image will not display on the root window if the image has more
unique colors than the target window colormap allows.  Use
\fB-colors\fP to reduce the number of colors.
.PP
In addition to those listed above, you can specify these standard X
resources as command line options:  \fB-background\fP,
\fB-bordercolor\fP, \fB-borderwidth\fP,  \fB-font\fP,
\fB-foreground\fP, \fB-iconGeometry\fP, \fB-iconic\fP, \fB-mattecolor\fP,
\fB-name\fP, or \fB-title\fP.  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.

Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.
For example, to animate two images, the first with 32 colors and the
second with only 16 colors, use:

.nf
     animate -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -colors 16 cockatoo.2
.fi

Options are processed in command line order.
Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.

By default, the image format is determined by its magic number. To
specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image
format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as
the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  See \fBconvert(1)\fP for a list
of valid image formats.

When you specify \fBX\fP as your image type, the filename has special
meaning.  It specifies an X window by id, name, or \fBroot\fP.  If no
filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in
the desired window.

Specify \fIfile\fP as \fI-\fP for standard input, If \fIfile\fP has the
extension \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP, the file is uncompressed with
\fBuncompress\fP or \fBgunzip\fP respectively. Precede the image file
name with \fI|\fP to pipe from a system command.

Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD
(e.g. img0001.pcd[4]) or a range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]).
A subimage specification can be disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]).
For raw images, specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g.  -size 640x512
image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

Single images are read with the filename you specify.  Alternatively,
you can animate an image sequence with a single filename.  Define the
range of the image sequence with \fI-scene\fP.  Each image in the
range is read with the filename followed by a period (\fB.\fP)
and the scene number.  You can change this behavior by embedding a
\fBprintf\fP format specification in the file name.  For example,

.nf
     -scene 0-9 image%02d.miff
.fi

animates files image00.miff, image01.miff, through image09.miff.

Image filenames may appear in any order on the command line if the image
format is \fIMIFF\fP (refer to \fBmiff(5)\fP and the \fBscene\fP keyword is
specified in the image.  Otherwise the images will display in the order
they appear on the command line.
.SH BUTTONS
Press any button to map or unmap the Command widget.  See
the next section for more information about the Command widget.
.SH COMMAND WIDGET
The Command widget lists a number of sub-menus and commands.  They are

.nf

Menu items with a indented triangle have a sub-menu.  They are
represented above as the indented items.  To access a sub-menu item,
move the pointer to the appropriate menu and press a button and drag.
When you find the desired sub-menu item, release the button and the
command is executed.  Move the pointer away from the sub-menu if you
decide not to execute a particular command.
.SH KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS
Accelerators are one or two key presses that effect a particular command.
The keyboard accelerators that \fBanimate(1)\fP understands is:
.TP

number of unique colors in the image.
.TP
.B "Ctl-q"
Press to discard all images and exit program.
.SH "X RESOURCES"
\fBanimate\fP options can appear on the command line or in your X
resource file.  Options on the command line supersede values specified
in your X resource file.  See \fBX(1)\fP for more information on X
resources.

All \fBanimate\fP options have a corresponding X resource.  In addition,
the \fBanimate\fP program uses the following X resources:
.TP
.B background (\fIclass\fP Background)
Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window background.  The
default is #ccc.
.TP
.B borderColor (\fIclass\fP BorderColor)
Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window border.  The
default is #ccc.
.TP
.B borderWidth (\fIclass\fP BorderWidth)
Specifies the width in pixels of the Image window border.  The default is 2.
.TP
.B font (\fIclass\fP Font or FontList)
Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in normal formatted
text.  The default is 14 point \fIHelvetica\fP.
.TP
.B foreground (\fIclass\fP Foreground)
Specifies the preferred color to use for text within the Image window.  The
default is black.
.TP
.B geometry (\fIclass\fP geometry)
Specifies the preferred size and position of the image window.
It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.
.TP
.B iconGeometry (\fIclass\fP IconGeometry)
Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when
iconified.  It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.
.TP
.B iconic (\fIclass\fP Iconic)
This resource indicates that you would prefer that the application's
windows initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately
iconified by you.  Window managers may choose not to honor the
application's request.
.TP
.B matteColor (\fIclass\fP MatteColor)
Specify the color of windows.  It is used for the backgrounds of
windows, menus, and notices.  A  3D  effect  is achieved  by
using highlight and shadow colors derived from this color.  Default
value: #ddd.
.TP
.B name (\fIclass\fP Name)
This resource specifies the name under which resources for the
application should be found.  This resource is useful in shell aliases to
distinguish between invocations of an application, without resorting to
creating links to alter the executable file name.  The default is the
application name.
.TP
.B sharedMemory (\fIclass\fP SharedMemory)
This resource specifies whether animate should attempt use shared memory
for pixmaps.  ImageMagick must be compiled with shared memory support,
and the display must support the MIT-SHM extension.  Otherwise, this
resource is ignored.  The default is True.
.TP
.B text_font (\fIclass\fP textFont)
Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style)
formatted text.  The default is 14 point \fICourier\fP.
.TP
.B title (\fIclass\fP Title)
This resource specifies the title to be used for the Image window.  This
information is sometimes used by a window manager to provide some sort
of header identifying the window.  The default is the image file name.
