	* linc2/src/linc-connection.c: (link_connections_close): Convert
	a FIXME g_warning into a code comment. Bug #581914.

========================== 2.14.17 ========================

2009-01-09  Fridrich Strba  <fridrich.strba@bluewin.ch>

	* configure.in: Add a warning saying that the borked-linking-test
	could not be run when cross-compiling.
	* configure.in, Makefile.shared: allow to specify an external idl
	compiler during the build so that we can use the native compiler while
	cross-compiling. The fallback is the current situation, the internal
	idl compiler is used.

2009-01-09  Fridrich Strba  <fridrich.strba@bluewin.ch>

	* configure.in: add fallback action to AC_TRY_RUN to allow cross-
	compiling since that one is not possible to override with config.cache
	file.

	Bug 547885 - ORBit2 should not call g_thread_init() itself as it
	is usually too late

	The change to linc2 mentioned in the below ChangeLog entry has
	been reverted. I didn't bother to revert the corresponding changes
	to src/orb/GIOP/giop.c and the test programs, they are harmless
	even with the reverted linc2 behaviour. And I still think that it
	is more correct to call g_thread_init() from main() in an
	ORBit2-using program, even if it happens to work not to do it, at
	least on Linux.

	Bug 547885 - ORBit2 should not call g_thread_init() itself as it
	is usually too late

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c (giop_init): Don't assume that link_init()
	managed to actually take threads into use if requested to. See
	linc2/ChangeLog. Check with giop_thread_safe().

	and const. Closes bug #554564.

2008-09-26  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c [Win32]: A DllMain() function
	shouldn't really call functions in other DLLs. Just save the
	HMODULE of the libORBit-2 DLL. Don't calculate the typelib
	directory and system rcfile paths in DllMain(), do it as needed in
	separate functions. Simplyfy code by using
	g_win32_get_package_installation_directory_of_module().

	* src/orb/orb-core/orb-core-private.h
	* src/orb/util/orbit-options.c: Corresponding changes.

2008-09-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* NEWS: Updated. 
	* configure.in: Bump again.

======================= 2.14.16 ============================

2008-09-16  Jules Colding  <colding@42tools.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (ORBit_ORB_start_servers):
	The ORBNetID option was not consistent in relation to
	ORBIIOPIPName. This fix ensures that ORBIIOPIPName always
	takes precedence. It also fixed the fact that the given
	ORBNetID was not applied to all part of the profile,
	specifically not the IOP_TAG_INTERNET_IOP part.

2008-09-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Post release bump.

======================= 2.14.15 ============================

2008-08-28  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/orb/orb-core/Makefile.am: Fix a possible infinite
	make loop with parallel make. Diego Pettenò. Closes
	bug #549693.

======================== 2.14.14 ============================

2008-08-11  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c (giop_tmpdir_init): use ORBIT_SOCKETDIR
	to propagate the socket dir to children wherever possible: has
	two benefits: speeds up ORBit2 launch, and allows root owned
	apps to talk to the user's AT.

2008-08-06  Jules Colding  <colding@42tools.com>

	* test/ior-decode.c (main): Fix terminology. The ID previously
	known as the "Object ID" is really the "Interface Repository ID".

2008-07-18  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* test/typelib-dump.c (dump_tc): remove redundant code
	causing warnings - thanks JP.

	* src/services/imodule/Makefile.am:
	* test/everything/Makefile.am:
	Patch from <dmacks at netspace org> to fix
	compile failures from passing global -I flags
	before local ones. Closes bug #538514.

2008-06-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	Bug 536505 - Error building 2.14.13 - implicit declaration of
	function '_strnicmp'

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbhttp.c: Use g_ascii_strncasecmp() instead of
	strncasecmp() or _strnicmp(). _strnicmp() is Microsoft-specific and
	was introduced in this file by accident in the patch for bug
	524061 below. But actually, you shouldn't be using --enable-http.

	headers. Bug #535474.

2008-05-25  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/poa/poa.c: Include <config.h> before checking HAVE_UNISTD_H.

	* src/orb/orbit-init.c
	* src/orb/poa/poa.c
	* src/orb/util/genrand.c: Windows does have a getpid() in its C
	library. It's just declared in <process.h> and not <unistd.h>
	(which doesn't even exist with MSVC), so include <process.h> on
	Windows instead of using a #define getpid() GetCurrentProcessId().

2008-05-07  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-trace.c (ORBit_trace_value):
	slow down, but substantially improve string printing in
	debugging, and add ORBIT2_DEBUG_STRMAX for long strings.

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c (giop_thread_free): armour against
	double thingits; and NULL the giop_main_thread as we free
	it: from nasty problems having shut-down the 'main' thread
	in yast, and started doing calls from another non-main thread.

2008-04-24  Jules Colding  <colding@42tools.com>

	* test/timeout-client.c (object_ref_from_file): Add terminating
	null character to IOR string. Furthermore corrected the name of
	the IOR file.

2008-02-01  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* test/poa/poatest-exception.h: Fix warning from gcc 4.3.

2008-01-29  Christian Persch  <chpe@gnome.org>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-typecode.c: (tc_dec): Use G_STRFUNC, since

2008-01-25  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* NEWS: Forgot to commit this.
	* configure.in: Post release bump.

========================== 2.14.11 ========================

2008-01-11  J. Specht <j.specht@z-extern.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-object.c (CORBA_Object__imethods):
	fix broken method name lengths - all off by one.

2007-11-12  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c (giop_byteswap): This function is only 
	used in this file so there is really no need to keep giop-endian.[ch] 
	around any more.

2007-10-30  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* test/timeout-server.c (create_ipv4_orb): Drop unnecessary
	zeroing of the argv as the code below assigns all elements of it
	anyway. And the third argument to memset() was wrong.

2007-10-29  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* include/orbit/GIOP/giop-connection.h
	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-small.c (ORBit_small_connection_unref):
	Adapt to change of prototype of link_connection_ref() and
	link_connection_unref().

2007-10-17  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* test/timeout.sh: Use the killall command only on Linux. On
	Solaris, for instance, the killall command does something
	different... On other systems ask the user to manually kill the
	timeout-server and/or lt-timeout-server processes.

2007-10-15  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

2007-09-25  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* test/timeout-server.c (main): Do not write more into the
	IOR file than really needed

	* test/timeout-client.c (main): Fix memory leaks
	(object_ref_from_file): Do not allocate more memory than 
	really needed

2007-09-24  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* ORBit2: Add G_OBJECT() casts to all cases of g_unref_object()

	* ORBit2: Removed ORBIT_DEBUG_CFLAGS from all Makefile.am's.
	Instead appended the debug flags directly to CFLAGS in 
	configure.in. The debug flags would otherwise be masked by
	CFLAGS and have next to no effect in terms of debug symbols.

	* ORBit2: It is now possible to use the ORBNetID command
	line option to specify a specific NIC to be used by ORBit2
	when creating externally visible objects. This is supported 
	by adding LINK_NET_ID_IS_CUSTOM to the LinkNetIdType enum 
	type. Previously the first NIC which wasn't "127.0.0.1" was 
	unconditionally used.
	
	The ORBNetID argument must be of a format that is compatible 
	to the address format that is returned by inet_ntoa(3) on a 
	return value of the SIOCGIFCONF ioctl. A specific IP address,
	such as '192.168.2.45', would be an acceptable format.

	The previous behavior of just using the first non "127.0.0.1" 
	NIC is maintained if the net id isn't LINK_NET_ID_IS_CUSTOM. 

	If, on the other hand, the net id is LINK_NET_ID_IS_CUSTOM then
	the used NIC will be:

	1) The net id specified but only if it is found in the interface
	list as	returned by SIOCGIFCONF.

	2) If the requested net id isn't found in the list then it will
	be the last non "0.0.0.0" addressed NIC in said list. This may 
	or may not be "127.0.0.1".

	I considered if we should use assert() if the specified net id 
	isn't found or if it is invalid, but I decided against it on the 
	grounds that not doing so is more in line with current behavior.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (ORBit_ORB_start_servers): 
	Support the new LINK_NET_ID_IS_CUSTOM functionality

2007-09-24  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-small.c (async_recv_cb): 
	Set CORBA_TIMEOUT exception if state is LINK_TIMEOUT

2007-09-22  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* configure.in: Added -O0 to ORBIT_DEBUG_CFLAGS. 
	TODO: Still need to fix the debug CFLAGS so that they are 
	effective in the Makefile.am's.

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-connection.c (giop_connection_close): 
	Added a check for the link being in LINK_TIMEOUT state. Not
	doing this would result in link_connection_finalize() being
	invoked twice for the same link. We can not have that...

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-recv-buffer.c (giop_recv_buffer_get): 
	Use giop_connection_unref() instead of linc_connection_unref()
	as we really are manipulating a GIOPConnection not a LinkConnection.
	(giop_timeout): Use the giop_connection_(un)ref() functions. Same 
	reasoning as above. 
	Do not call link_connection_state_changed() or giop_incoming_signal_T()
	if the link is in the LINK_DISCONNECTED state. Doing so would make
	link_connection_state_changed() very unhappy (invalid read of size 1).

==================== ORBit2-2.14.9 =====================

2007-09-17  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* test/Makefile.am: Clean iorfile to make distcheck happy.

2007-08-31  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-recv-buffer.c (giop_recv_buffer_get): Make sure
	nothing is NULL before referencing it

2007-08-22  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-recv-buffer.c (giop_timeout_add): 
	Use LinkConnection native ref function instead of g_object_ref()
	(giop_recv_buffer_get): Use LinkConnection native unref function 
	instead of g_object_unref()
	(giop_timeout): Use LinkConnection native unref function instead 
	of g_object_unref()

	* configure.in: Fix 'if test' statement

2007-08-14  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-send-buffer.c (giop_send_buffer_write): Do
	not enter giop_timeout_add() if a timeout is already present. This 
	check is not thread safe, but the additional check in giop_timeout_add()
	is.

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-recv-buffer.c (giop_timeout_add): Fix
	race when creating the timeout mutex.
	Do not depend on the dynamically created "struct timeout_thread_data". 
	The right thing to do is to pass the connection directly and add an 
	additional member to the LincConnection	to hold the GIOPThread.
	(giop_timeout): Correct to use new input data (LincConnection*).
	(giop_recv_buffer_get): Fix memory leak.

2007-08-07  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* test/timeout_impl.c (impl_Timeout_ping): Use g_usleep() instead
	of sleep() for portability. (#464094, Andreas Köhler)

	exception was used without having been initialized (bug #452428)

2007-03-18  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* linc2/src/linc-protocols.c: Now always set the
	  LINC_PROTOCOL_NEEDS_BIND flag in the
	  static_link_protocols array for both IPv4 and IPv6
	  This is needed on Solaris because bind is needed to
	  open the ports securely when ORBLocalOnly is being 
	  used.  The maintainers decided that it would be best
	  to simply turn the flag on for all platorms rather
	  than support complicated ifdefs since this should not
	  cause any issues.  Fixes bug #422908.

======================= ORBit2-2.14.4 ===========================

2006-12-18  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Release 2.14.4.

2006-12-12  Christian Persch  <chpe@cvs.gnome.org>

	* autogen.sh:
	* configure.in:
	Don't use deprecated autoconf macros. Use AM 1.9. Bug #383527.

2006-12-05  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* ORBit2: The previous two ChangeLog entries are hiding a lot of 
	details which I'll hereby try to expand upon. 

	The rationale for these changes is that any and all occurrences of 
	g_cond_wait() in ORBit2 has the potential to block forever if it 
	waits for a connection attempt to complete if said connection 
	attempt is made towards a remote server which happens to be 
	physically disconnected or powered off. 

	This blocking behavior can be demonstrated by invoking an operation 
	on a remote object that is physically inaccessible such as when
	the remote server is powered down or physically disconnected.

	Pseudo code:
	
	{
	    CORBA_ORB orb = get_orb();
	    char *objref = get_corbaloc_str();
	    CORBA_Object obj = CORBA_OBJECT_NIL;
	    CORBA_Environment ev[1];
	
	    CORBA_exception_init(ev);
	    obj = CORBA_ORB_string_to_object(orb, objref, ev);

	    FOO_INTERFACE_method(obj, <arguments>, ev); 
	}

	The last statement above will block forever in g_cond_wait() while
	waiting for the recieve buffer to be ready if the remote server is, 
	say, powered down. An exception is on the other hand immediately 
	thrown if the server object is merely gone.

	The changes to the code therefore boils down to the implementation 
	of the ex_CORBA_TIMEOUT system exception being thrown if 
	g_cond_timed_wait() times out. Most occurrences of g_cond_wait() 
	has been replaced by g_cond_timed_wait(). 

	The only remaining instance of g_cond_wait() is found in 
	link_exec_command(). I haven't observed any problems with 
	link_exec_command() so I've not touched that code.

	The affected code is:

	1) A new ORB command line option: GIOPTimeoutLimit - timeout limit 
	in microseconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.

	2) giop_recv_buffer_get(). This one is obvious. We do not want to 
	wait indefinitely for data to be received from a downed host. The 
	waiting interval is configurable with the new GIOPTimeoutLimit ORB 
	option.

	3) Any code invoking link_wait():

	   a) link_connection_wait_connected_T()
	   b) link_connection_try_reconnect()
	   c) giop_connection_try_reconnect(), calls link_connection_try_reconnect()
	   d) ORBit_try_connection_T(), calls giop_connection_try_reconnect()
	   e) ORBit_object_get_connection(), calls ORBit_try_connection_T()

	4) The waiting time in link_wait() is set at compile time to 
	LINK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_USEC which is presently 10 seconds.

	5) link_wait() has been modified to return a gboolean. FALSE if the
	timeout expired, TRUE otherwise.

	6) link_connection_wait_connected_T() and link_connection_try_reconnect() 
	will both disconnect the connection if link_wait() experienced a timeout.

2006-12-04  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* configure.in: Added autoconf 2.60+ required datarootdir variable

2006-12-03  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* include/orbit/GIOP/giop.h: Declare giop_recv_set_timeout().

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (CORBA_ORB_init): Set GIOP timeout 
	limit from the ORB option.
	Added new ORB option - GIOPTimeoutLimit.

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-small.c (ORBit_small_invoke_stub): Throw a 
	TIMEOUT exception if a reply hasn't been recieved within the GIOP
	timeout limit.

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-recv-buffer.c (giop_recv_buffer_get): Replaced 
	a g_cond_wait() with a g_cond_timed_wait(). The original g_cond_wait()
	could potentially block forever if a remote server was physically
	offline.
	(giop_recv_set_timeout): Function to adjust the GIOP timeout limit.

2006-11-22  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* ORBit-2.0.pc.in: Move MINGW_CFLAGS and LIBM to Libs.private

	* configure.in: Use PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG instead of manual stuff.
	suggested by dmacks at netspace org. Closes bug #345729.

2006-11-22  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	compiler warnings.

2006-11-10  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* ORBit-2.0.pc.in: move gmodules-no-export-2.0 to Requires-private.
	Reported by Samuel Thibault. Closes bug #352198.

2006-11-10  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	local.

====================== ORBit2-2.14.3 ======================

2006-08-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* linc2/src/linc-connection.c: Patch to correct problem where

2006-08-16  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (ORBit_get_giop_recv_limit): Added
	gtk-doc documentation.

2006-08-08  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* linc2/src/linc-protocols.c: Modify ORBLocalOnly test for TCP/IP
	  connections so that differences in the port number does not cause
	  the test to fail.  Since the port number does not affect whether
          the IP address is local, this should make the test work properly
	  on platforms where the access () function fills in the port value
	  that is being compared.  On Solaris, this fixes a bug that causes
	  Java a11y to break, from an end-user perspective.

2006-08-07  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* configure.in (CFLAGS): Fix #147556

	* acinclude.m4: Added AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION

2006-06-23  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c: Set orbit_local_only to TRUE on
	Win32, to go with the use of IPv4 on Win32. We don't want to
	create world-contactable sockets by default. Note that for
	orbit_local_only to actually work, a small fix to the linc2 code
	was also needed, see the ChangeLog over there.

2006-06-20  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c: Remove the giop_thread_list, isn't used for
	anything.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (CORBA_ORB_init): Don't call
	g_atexit() on Win32. It can cause bizarre bugs. The semantics of
	atexit() are very hard to specify exactly in the presence of
	dynamic libraries, and Win32's implementation is perhaps
	particularily random in its behaviour. Just rely on any peers we
	are talking to noticing that the connections are severed and
	acting appropriately.

2006-06-17  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-deps.c: (orbit_idl_output_c_deps):

	* configure.in: Release 2.13.3.

2006-02-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	Improve configury on Win32, patch by Georg Steffers:

	* configure.in: Set MINGW_LDFLAGS to
	-Wl,--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc on Win32. AC_SUBST it. That GNU
	ld flag is needed when building software that uses DLLs containing
	code produced by the ORBit2 IDL compiler, because of the way
	variables imported from DLLs are used. Add MINGW_LDFLAGS to the
	LDFLAGS used when building ORBit2 itself, too.

	* ORBit-2.0.pc.in: Add @MINGW_LDFLAGS@ (empty on Unix) to Libs .

	* ORBit2.m4: If no orbit2-config script is found, use pkg-config.

2006-01-13  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* include/orbit/orb-core/corba-orb.h: Added ORBit_proto_use() to 
	ORBIT2_EXTENSIONS section. This is needed to deduce protocol
	capabilities if you are not the fortunate first thread to invoke 
	CORBA_ORB_init().

2005-09-07  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* configure.in (LT_VERSION): Version 2.13.2. This is needed as the change

	* configure.in: Bumping minor LT_VERSION since 
	  interfaces have changed since the initial ORBit2
	  release and it has never been bumped, but 
	  interfaces have been added since that time. 
	  Sorry for commiting this twice, but I didn't
	  read the comments closely to see that you
	  modify it to C+1:0:A+1 to indicate interfaces
	  have been added but binary compatibility has
	  been preserved.

	Valid values for a hypothetical local host (FQDN:thor.test.com, IP:10.0.3.2):
	   "local": all attempts to resolve the local host will be done using "localhost"
	   "short": all attempts to resolve the local host will be done using "thor".
	   "fqdn" : all attempts to resolve the local host will be done using "thor.test.com".
	   "ipaddr: all attempts to resolve the local host will be done using "10.0.3.2".
	The new option will be evaluated after ORBLocalOnly but ORBLocalOnly will always take
	precedence.

	(CORBA_ORB_destroy), (ORBit_ORB_forw_bind): 
	* src/orb/poa/orbit-adaptor.c: (ORBit_forw_bind_find),

2005-06-03  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* docs/README: Added pointers to documentation and sample code 
	for developers using ORBit2, not ORBit2 hackers.

2005-06-02  Sandie Vanderme  <sandie.vanderme@bull.net>

	* configure.in: add missing AC_CHECK_HEADERS(netdb.h)

2005-04-18  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (DllMain): As we reguire GLib 2.6,
	no need to use GLIB_CHECK_VERSION(). And anyway, what we really
	should have used here was the run-time glib_check_version() and
	not compile-time GLIB_CHECK_VERSION()... Also, only check for a
	"bin" subfolder. DLLs are always installed in "bin" and not "lib"
	nowadays.

	* src/orb/orb-core/orb-core-private.h: As we require GLib 2.6,
	G_IS_DIR_SEPARATOR() is always present.

2005-04-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* linc2/test/test-linc.c: Make some variables static.
	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skelimpl.c: Same

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-object.c :
	(ORBit_object_get_connection): if we have failed on the unix
	socket, have IPv4 or IPv6 connections enabled and are on localhost,
	then don't connect on the corresponding port from the profiles.
	Patch reviewed by Michael Meeks.

2005-04-13  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/util/genrand.c: Use the Win32 crypto API.

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c
	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-backend.c: Use gstdio wrappers for
	better localized filename support on Win32. Use GLib directory and
	filename API. Don't bother with the rather useless utime() setting
	on the GIOP tmpdir on Win32. Use g_strerror() instead of
	strerror().

	* src/orb/util/orbit-options.c: As we reguire GLib 2.6, no need to
	use GLIB_CHECK_VERSION.

2005-04-12  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* ORBit-2.0.pc.in: require gmodule-no-export-2.0 rather
	than gmodule-2.0 so we don't -export-dynamic on our
	link line.

2005-04-11  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* test/everything/Makefile.am (Everything_module_la_LIBADD): Need
	to link with ORBIT_LIBS thanks to a recent change for Win32 in
	HEAD GLib.

2005-04-11  James Henstridge  <james@jamesh.id.au>

	* configure.in: rename PKG_CONFIG_MIN_VERSION variable to

	* include/orbit/orb-core/orbit-object.h: Add macro
	ORBIT2_MAYBE_CONST which expands to "const" on Unix, empty on
	Win32.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-typecode.c
	* include/orbit/orb-core/corba-orb-type.h
	* include/orbit/orb-core/corba-typecode.h
	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-headers.c (ch_type_alloc_and_tc)
	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-typecode.c
	(orbit_output_tcstruct_anon_subtypes_array,
	orbit_output_tcstruct_anon_sublabels_array, cbe_tc_generate): Use
	ORBIT2_MAYBE_CONST. This reintroduces constness on Unix, saving
	some memory. (#169428)
	
2005-03-10  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 2.13.0 to distinguish from the
	gnome-2-10 branch. Call AC_CANONICAL_HOST before the Win32 test to
	make sure $host is set up. Require GLib 2.6.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-main.c: Make the default not to show
	CPP errors, so that --showcpperrors actually changes the
	behaviour.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c (ORBit_demarshal_value)
	* src/services/imodule/orbit-imodule.c (build_cpp_args): Minor
	const correctness fixes.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c: Drop inclusion of <windows.h>, we
	get it through <winsock2.h> in linc-protocol.h anyway. Add
	prototype for DllMain() to silence gcc.

2005-02-23  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* orbit2-zip.in: Include also etc/orbitrc (even if it is
	empty). Don't include lib/orbit-2.0, just the Everything_module
	gets installed there by ORBit2, and that's just for testing.

	* configure.in: Drop the -DPOPT_STATIC. The version of popt that
	we recommend is used on Windows doesn't cause import of variables
	from libpopt. Using a libpopt DLL works fine.

	* test/test-giop.c (run_test): Use IPv4 instead of UNIX domain
	sockets on Win32.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skels.c
	(cbe_skel_interface_print_relayers): It's the temporary pointer
	that should be declared volatile, not what it's pointing to. Now
	auto-import actually works also from optimized code.

2005-02-21  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Use -DPOPT_STATIC on Win32 when building the IDL
	compiler and name server, so that we avoid the problems with
	referring to variables imported from a DLL in static
	initializers. In newer libpopt distributions the headers have
	dllimport decorations for the variables exported from libpopt
	unless one defines POPT_STATIC.

	To actually then link with the static libpopt.a you might also
	have to move the import library libpopt.dll.a away so that the
	linker won't find it, and perhaps edit libpopt.la.

	Remove leftover AC_MSG_WARN([host is $host]).

2005-02-14  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: New autoconf variable LIBM, set to -lm on Unix,
	empty on Windows.

	* ORBit-2.0.pc.in (Libs): Use @LIBM@. The dummy -lm in mingw prevents
	libtool from creating DLLs.
	(orbit_idl): Append @EXEEXT@.

	* src/idl-compiler/Makefile.am
	* test/Makefile.am: Use $(LIBM) here, less verbiage than if using
	an automake ifdef.

	* src/orb/orb-core/orb-core-private.h
	* src/orb/util/orbit-options.c: On Win32, #undef the compile-time
	pathnames from the Makefiles, instead use run-time strings set up
	by DllMain(), see below.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (DllMain): New function. When
	ORBit2 is built as a DLL on Win32 (as it should be), this function
	is called automatically when the DLL is loaded. It fetches the
	full path of the DLL, and deduces the ORBit2 installation folder
	from that. Then it forms the type library directory and system
	orbitrc path names. Some complexity needed by it having to work
	both when built with GLib 2.4 or 2.6.

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-typelib.c (ORBit_small_load_typelib): Use
	GLib API to check pathnames, for improved Win32 portability.

	* src/orb/util/orbit-options.c (ORBit_option_rc_parse): When built
	against GLib 2.6, use g_fopen().
	(ORBit_option_parse): Guard against g_get_home_dir() returning
	NULL.

	* src/orb/util/genrand.c (ORBit_genuid_init): Bypass the attempts
	to use /dev/urandom on Win32.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c (ORBit_marshal_value): Don't do any
	post-realignment for array elements. We don't do that for array
	elements in ORBit_demarshal_value() either, and the marshalling of
	structs and unions already takes care of their post-alignment.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-utils.c: Revert the change from
	2005-02-01. It's unnecessary now with the alignment fixes in the
	marshalling code. (The changes were not sufficient anyway; without
	the alignment fixes in the marshalling code, even more sillyness
	in the IDL compiler generated code would have been necessary to
	make it work on Win32.)

2005-02-13  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c (ORBit_ORB_start_servers): if we
	are using LocalOnly option or only UNIX sockets then set
	hostname to be "localhost"
	Patch reviewed by Michael Meeks
	
2005-02-11  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-trace.c (ORBit_trace_value): Print also
	long long values, using G_GINT64_FORMAT. Ditto unsigned long long
	and G_GUINT64_FORMAT.

2005-02-11  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/orb/dynamic/dynany.c
	(DynamicAny_DynStruct_get_members),
	(DynamicAny_DynStruct_set_members): add field
	alignment logic now missing from ORBit_copy_value etc.

2005-02-11  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c
	(ORBit_marshal_value, ORBit_demarshal_value),
	(ORBit_copy_value_core, ORBit_value_equivalent):
	re-work, bin pre-align: assume incoming ABI walking
	data is aligned, do alignment only on outgoing
	data & during struct/union walking.

	* test/everything/arrayServer.c
	(ArrayServer_opAlignHoleStructArray),
	(ArrayServer_opStrArray): add.
	* test/everything/unionServer.c
	(UnionServer_opFixedLengthUnionArray): add

	* test/everything/client.c (testUnionArray, testStrArray),
	(testFixedLengthStructArray, testAlignHoleStructArray),
	(testVariableLengthArray): add more beef to the regression
	test suite.

2005-02-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* orbit2-zip.in: New file, expands to a script to be used for
	packaging ORBit2 distributions as zipfiles for Windows.

	* configure.in
	* Makefile.am: Generate and distribute it.

2005-02-07  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* test/Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS): Must use check_PROGRAMS as
	the name for the list of test programs in order for Automake to
	properly use EXEEXT on Windows.

2005-02-02  Hans Petter Jansson  <hpj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Check for res_9_init() in -lresolv. This will pull in
	libresolv on Darwin, where the actual symbol's name is different from
	the one used by programs.

2005-02-02  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	Make test-dynany work on Windows:

	* src/orb/dynamic/dynany.c (MAKE_DYNANY_INSERT): For identical
	reasons as the below change to the IDL compiler, take a local copy
	of function parameter before passing its address to
	dynany_insert().

	(dynany_get_value): Take the alignment of preceding fields and the
	field itself into account when calculating the address of a field
	in a CORBA_tk_struct or except.

2005-02-01  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-utils.c (orbit_cbe_flatten_ref):
	Take output file as parameter, output directly there instead of
	returning a string.

	Don't take the address of function parameters and pass it on to
	the marshalling layers. Function parameters are not necessarily
	aligned according to the alinments in orbit-config.h. Case in
	point: long long on the x86. ORBIT_ALIGNOF_CORBA_LONG_LONG is 8,
	but as function parameters on the stack, long longs only have
	4-byte alignment. The lower levels will realign the address,
	meaning long long IN parameters might have a completely wrong
	value marshalled. The same presumably holds for doubles and long
	doubles. Why this problem hasn't occured on Linux on x86, no
	idea. I noticed it on Windows.

	Instead, copy IN parameters to a field in a local struct variable,
	and pass on the address of that field.

	In theory, the above could hold on exotic architectures also for
	OUT parameters, where the address of a parameter is also passed
	on. But in that case the parameter is a pointer, and at least on
	the x86, a pointer's alignment as parameter matches expectation in
	orbit-config.h (4).

	(orbit_cbe_maybe_copy_of_data_in): New helper function that
	outputs the definition and initialization of the local copy of IN
	parameters mentioned above.

	(orbit_cbe_flatten_args): Modify accordingly.

2005-01-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orbit-init.c
	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-trace.c: Use g_get_current_time() instead
	of gettimeofday().

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c
	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-send-buffer.c
	* src/orb/orb-core/orbhttp.c: Conditionalize includes as
	necessary.

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop.c: Don't check owner on Win32 either. Add
	newline to dprintf() calls. Use socket API for wakeup pipe on
	Win32. Create it using link_pipe().

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c: Use IPv4 and not Unix domain
	sockets on Win32.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-typecode.c: Drop the const from the
	typecode struct definitions, for Win32 DLL import/export reasons
	(see yesterday's ChangeLog entries).

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbhttp.c (orbHTTPConnectAttempt): Drop an
	unused variable in the WinSock part.

	* src/orb/orb-core/orbit-typelib.c: Use G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR_S.

	* src/orb/util/genrand.c: No getuid() on Win32.

	* src/services/name/Makefile.am: No -lm on Win32.

	* src/services/name/boot.c: Conditionalize use of syslog and
	sigaction.

	* src/services/name/orbit-name-server.c: Remove a couple of
	unneeded includes.

	* test/echo-client.c: Make debugging easier: If argv[1] starts
	with a dollar, fetch it with getenv().

	* test/echo-server.c
	* test/empty-server.c
	* test/any-server.c: Output the IOR: string to a file, too, to
	avoid having to copy-paste long strings when runnning these tests.

	* test/typelib-dump.c: Small workaround for Win32 DLL variable
	import restriction.

	* test/everything/test.sh: Don't run the Unix domain socket tests
	on Windows. Don't exit after a failed test if $DONT_EXIT is set.

	* test/everything/client.c (main)
	* test/everything/server.c (main): Small const correctness fix.

2005-01-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/Makefile.am
	* test/Makefile.am: No separate -lm on Win32.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-backend.c: mkdir() has different
	prototype in Microsoft's C library.

	Below changes from Cygwin port of ORBit2 by Gerrit P. Haase, see
	www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-apps/2004-10/msg00030.html. They also
	apply to native Win32.

	* include/orbit/orb-core/corba-orb-type.h
	* include/orbit/orb-core/corba-typecode.h: Drop the constness of
	extern structs as it causes problems when building libORBit-2 as a
	DLL on Win32 and Cygwin. 

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-headers.c (ch_type_alloc_and_tc)
	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-typecode.c
	(orbit_output_tcstruct_anon_subtypes_array,
	orbit_output_tcstruct_anon_sublabels_array, cbe_tc_generate): Drop
	constness from generated code, for Win32 DLL reasons as above.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skels.c (cbe_skel_interface_print_relayers):
	Workaround Win32 restriction, use a temporary variable. (See ld
	documentation for --enable-auto-import, and for instance
	http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-09/msg00130.html)

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-main.c: Drop constness from
	a poptOption array, for obscure Win32 DLL reasons.
	
2005-01-26  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Check also for utime.h, and sys/utime.h (where
	MSVC keeps it, in case we some day want to be compileable by it).

2005-01-26  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Changes for Win32: Set automake conditional
	OS_WIN32. Check for more headers and functions. Add WinSock
	library to LIBS.

	* include/orbit/GIOP/giop-connection.h: Don't include netdb.h on
	Win32. Is it even needed on Unix?

2005-01-13  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skelimpl.c (prev_char_is_nl): New function
	that implements check of previously written character to the output file.
	Excessive output of newline characters are fixed by checking the last
	character written: If it is '\n' then do not write another '\n'.
	(cbe_ski_do_list): The correct fix for exessive newline output.
	
	Generation of skelimpl files has been fixed by protecting definitions and
	declarations with #ifdef blocks. This is *not* the right fix. The right fix 
	would be to generate header files with the proper extern declarations. The
	current "fix" has the drawback of forcing the developer to include the 
	skelimpl files in inheritance order: Most common ancestor first, then 
	progressively later descendants. The right fix requires more redesign of 
	the code than I would like to do now, so this hack must suffice for the time 
	being. 

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-backend.c (out_for_pass): Change the opening
	mode of output files to "w+". This is needed to support the correct fix for 
	excessive newline output in skelimpl files.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skelimpl.c: I had a really hard time parsing 
	the code with the former indentation level of 2, so I changed it to a more
	reasonable 8.

2005-01-12  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-main.c (main): Fix print of passes.

2005-01-01  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skelimpl.c (cbe_ski_do_list): Fix the former 
	fix for excessive newline output (integer overflow bug fixed).

2004-12-28  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-skelimpl.c (cbe_ski_do_list): Prevent excessive 
	output of newlines for skelimpl files.

2004-12-27  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* configure.in: Remove support for external indentation command.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-main.c: Removed all traces of the output formatter 
	command line option but leave a warning.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-backend.c (out_for_pass): "popen ==> fopen" for 
	all output files. The reason is to avoid opening a pipe as we don't want to use
	an externally invoked indentation process.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl3-types.h: Removed output_formatter.

2004-12-22  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* test/everything/everything.idl: Added test for bug#161879.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-utils.c (orbit_cbe_get_const): Fix IDL compilation 
	of "const char N = '\x0A';" definitions (bug#161879).

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl3-types.h: Added output_directory to OIDL_Run_Info.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-backend.c: Prefixed output file with output directory.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-main.c: Added 'output-dir' command line option.

2004-12-17  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c (ORBit_demarshal_value):
	don't fail de-marshalling null & void - just do nothing.
	(ORBit_copy_value_core): just copy nothing for void & null
	- instead of breaking the val pointer.

2004-10-02  Gustavo J. A. M. Carneiro  <gustavo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/everything/client.c (testAnySequence),
	* test/everything/server.c (SequenceServer_opAnySeq):
	implement test for TC_void bug.
	
2004-12-13  Joe McCann  <joem@gentoo.org>

	* configure.in: bump libIDL dep to 0.8.2.

2004-11-12  Sandie Vanderme  <sandie.vanderme@bull.net>

	* include/orbit/orb-core/Makefile.am
	(IDL_FLAGS_NO_DEFS): add src/orb/orb-core.

2004-10-19  Paolo Borelli  <pborelli@katamail.com>

	* src/idl-compiler/Makefile.am: fix linking, patch by Jimmy Do.

2004-10-02  Gustavo J. A. M. Carneiro  <gustavo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-env.c (CORBA_exception_set): Before
	overwriting an exception, free any previous value contained by it.
	Patch by Michael Meeks.  Fixes #153299.

2004-09-13  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* configure.in: Version 2.12.0.

2004-08-25  Michael Haubenwallner <michael.haubenwallner@salomon.at>

	* src/orb/orb-core/allocators.c (ORBit_freekids_via_TypeCode_T):
	Step over align-holes at the end of structures (bug#151023)
	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c
	(ORBit_marshal_value) (ORBit_demarshal_value)
	(ORBit_copy_value_core) (ORBit_value_equivalent):
	Ditto.
	* test/everything/everything.idl
	test/everything/client.c
	test/everything/structServer.c:
	Added testcase for bug#151023, align-holes at the end of structures.
	* test/everything/constants.h:
	Ditto.
	Added constants for CHAR and OCTET.

2003-08-07  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

2001-10-02  Laszlo Peter  <laca@ireland.sun.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/iop-profiles.c:

	* Version 2.3.95.

	* src/orb/dynamic/Makefile.am, src/orb/orb-core/Makefile.am,

2001-09-20  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/orb/GIOP/giop-connection.c (giop_connection_handle_input):
	If linc_connection_read returns 0 and was not passed a length
	of 0, then the connection has been closed. Unlock incoming_mutex

	hang when servers have dumped code while servicing a request.
	
2001-09-20  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

2001-09-19  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/orb/orb-core/Makefile.am: revert Darin's patch. That
	header is not generated by this rule.

2001-09-19  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/Makefile.am: Fix build by mentioning the
	generated header file explicitly as a target. Otherwise, the

	which uses the wrong flags.

	Implement orbitrc option handling.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c

	in include/orbit/orb-core/corba-typecode.h.

2001-09-19  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Fixes bug #60730

	courtesy of Dick I think.

	* src/orb/util/Makefile.am: update.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-orb.c,
	  src/orb/orb-core/orb-core-private.h

	the IIOP protocol options are implemented as yet.

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-object.c(ORBit_start_servers):
	check to see if we should use the protocol before starting
	a server using that protocol.

2001-09-18  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/orb/orb-core/Makefile.am: depend on $(IDL_COMPILER)
	not on $(IDL). hmmm.
	
2001-09-18  Jens Finke <jens@gnome.org>
	
	* ORBit.spec.in: Updated, matches gpp requirements now, renamed the
	package to ORBit2 and reworked the files section.

2001-09-17  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.shared: s/DEPS_MAGIC/IDL_DEPS_MAGIC/. Using
	the same variable name used by automake causes automake
	to get confused. This was causing automatic Makefile 
	dependancy tracking to not work.

2001-09-17  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/orb/poa/Makefile.am: remove bogus BUILT_SOURCE
	dependancy.

	* src/orb/poa/poa.c: clean up includes. Don't include
	corba-ops.h.

	libIDL.
	Also include stdlib.h.

2001-09-11  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/orb/orb-core/iop-profiles.c
	(IOP_profile_get_info): don't forget to return TRUE.

	* include/orbit/GIOP/giop-connection.h,
	  src/orb/GIOP/giop-connection.c
	(giop_connection_from_fd): this function is unused
	and unneeded. fds are handled inside linc.

2001-09-10  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* test/ior-decode.c: fixup object key handling.

	* include/orbit/GIOP/giop-server.h,
	  src/orb/GIOP/giop-server.c: minor tidying.
	
2001-09-09  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* test/everything/client.c (testMisc): expand regression
	tests.

	* src/orb/poa/poa.c (ORBit_POAObject_handle_request):
	return exceptions that we have thrown, re-organise the
	exception throwing code to flow more smoothly.
	(return_exception): impl; ie. with the old 'Lee' stubs,
	we have no way to tell that the method was oneway - so
	we might stil try and return an exception - another nail
	in it's coffin.

2001-09-09  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-typecode.c: fix alignment of
	CORBA_TC_Object, or we get serious marshaling issues.

	forward locations profiles.

	* src/orb/orb-core/iop-profiles.c,
	  src/orb/orb-core/iop-profiles.h
	(IOP_profile_find): remove unused.

	profiles anymore.
	(IOP_profiles_sync_objkey): impl.

	(IOP_ObjectKey_equal): export.
	(IOP_profile_equal): don't compare object keys.

	they are generated in include/orbit/orb-core.

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-headers.c
	(ch_output_const_dcl): implement the unsigned

	in the splendifuredness of libIDL ;)

2001-09-03 Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c,
	  src/orb/orb-core/orb-core-private.h

	  src/orb/orb-core/allocators.c,
	  src/orb/orb-core/corba-any.c,

	above change.

2001-09-03 Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* src/idl-compiler/orbit-idl-c-typecode.c:
	Big cleanup. Split out the generation of individual
	TypeCode members from cbe_tc_generate into seperate
	functions. Also seperate functions for various anon
	arrays.

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, 
	  include/orbit/orbit-config.h.in:
