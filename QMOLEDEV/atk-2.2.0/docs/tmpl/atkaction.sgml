<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
AtkAction

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
The ATK interface provided by UI components which the user can
activate/interact with,

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
#AtkAction should be implemented by instances of #AtkObject classes with
which the user can interact directly, i.e. buttons, checkboxes,
scrollbars,  e.g. components which are not "passive"
providers of UI information.
</para>
<para>
Exceptions: when the user interaction is already covered by
another appropriate interface such as #AtkEditableText (insert/delete
text, etc.) or #AtkValue (set value) then these actions should not be
exposed by #AtkAction as well.  
</para>
<para>
Also note that the #AtkAction API is limited in that parameters may not
be passed to the object being activated; thus the action must be
self-contained and specifiable via only a single "verb".  Concrete
examples include "press", "release", "click" for buttons, "drag"
(meaning initiate drag) and "drop" for drag sources and drop targets,
etc.  
</para>
<para>
Though most UI interactions on components should be invocable via
keyboard as well as mouse, there will generally be a close mapping
between "mouse actions" that are possible on a component and the
AtkActions.  Where mouse and keyboard actions are redundant in effect,
#AtkAction should expose only one action rather than exposing redundant
actions if possible.  By convention we have been using "mouse centric"
terminology for #AtkAction names.
