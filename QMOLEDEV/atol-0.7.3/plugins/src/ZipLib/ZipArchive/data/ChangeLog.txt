 ver 2.4.11 (07-2006)
	
	 Changes: 
	- Web Site rebuilt, which led to links change in documentation
	- minor tweaks
	
	 Bugs fixed: 
	- files were opened in text mode under some gcc versions

 ver 2.4.10 (04-2006)

 Bugs fixed: 

- CZipArchive::GetFromArchive would not work if a local filename size or an extra field size were different from the corresponding sizes in the central directory
- compilation error under gcc-4.1 (thanks to Miroslav Rajcic and Tuncer Ayaz for the fix)
- problems with directory creation under Linux (thanks to Neil Youngman for the fix)
- problems with zippie extraction (thanks to Neil Youngman for reporting it)
- zippie was not restoring the global locale; it was not causing problems with zippie, but nevertheless it is a good practice (thanks to Cecilia Herrera for reporting it)

 Changes: 

- CZipFileHeader::GetSize public method can only return the size of the info in the central directory
- the limit of number of archive parts has been changed to 99999 in TDSpan mode (the compatibility with other archivers is kept up to 99 parts)
- method CZipArchive::ExtractFile(WORD, CZipMemFile&, bool, DWORD) does not perform changing the current position of the memory file to the end before writing decompressed data to it - decompressed data is written at the current file position (existing data may be overwritten) (thanks to Jennis Meyer-Spradow for the suggestion)

 Features added: 

- CZipArchive::GetOccupiedSpace added
- CZipArchive::PredictMaximumFileSizeInArchive added
- CZipFileHeader::GetLocalSize added 

 ver 2.4.9 (02-2006)

 Features added: 
	
	- CZipArchive::SetTreatAsSingleDisk added for treating archives that have different disk numbers inside and yet are a single-disk archives
	- Visual Studio .NET 2005 compatibility
	
 Changes: 

	- the library now decompresses correctly the archive if the filename in the local file header is different from the filename in the central directory - it was considered an error so far	
	
 Bugs fixed: 
		
	- renaming files corrupted archive if local extra field size was different than the size of extra filed in the central directory (thanks to Dragan Milic for reporting and the fix)	
	- renaming files corrupted archive if local filename size was different than the size of the filename in the central directory
	- renaming files was not reflected in the local header if the new filename size was the same as the old one's (thanks to Dragan Milic for reporting and the fix)

	- method CZipArchive::ExtractFile(WORD, CZipMemFile&, bool, DWORD) positions the memory file pointer at the beginning of the compressed data after compression
	- CZipArchive::AddNewFile method now automaticaly sets the value of the file pointer (CZipAddNewFileInfo::m_pFile), if set, to the beginning of the file - performs CZipAbstractFile::SeekToBegin (thanks to Michael A. Rusakov for pointing this out)

	- added PKZIP_BUG_WORKAROUND definition to the zlib.h file distributed with ZipArchive library as well as to ZipArchive project files (in case the zlib library is replaced with a new version). 
	It deals with pkzip bug existing in some archives (thanks to Ben Jos Walbeehm for reporting).

 ver 2.3.2 (08-2002)

 Bug fixed: 
	
	- problem with creating disk spanning archives in the STL version of the library (thanks to Luiz Rafael Culik for reporting)

 ver 2.3.1 (05-2002)

 Bug fixed: 
	
	- using CZipMemFile::CZipMemFile(BYTE* , UINT , long ) constructor could cause memory errors (thanks to Laurent Dor)

 ver 2.3 (04-2002) (includes changes and fixes from 2.2a to 2.2c)

 Features added: 

	- Visual Studio .NET compatibility	
	- methods CZipArchive::GetFromArchive added, which allow copying files from another archive without decompressing them
	- many times requested replacing of files in the archive feature; it works with methods CZipArchive::GetFromArchive and a new 
		CZipArchive::AddNewFile(CZipAddNewFileInfo& ) which was introduced due to increasing parameters count
	- added method CZipArchive::RenameFile which renames a file in the archive maintaining its physical position inside the archive
	- projects and necessary changes for compiling ZipArchive as a DLL version (courtesy of Jonathan Reis) - see \ref subsDLL and \ref subDLLnotes
	( they are not embedded into existing ones, but made separated, since the DLL version needs separated project for zlib.dll and for the static version,
	zlib library is already included in the projects to minimize linking problems with applications)
	- added CZipArchive::WillBeDuplicated which lets you check quickly if the given filename would duplicate an existing one in the archive 
	- CZipArchive::GetCount has now an additional parameter and can return the number of files in the archive not counting the directories
	- CZipArchive::Close has been given also an additional parameter (bUpdateTimeStamp) and can set the modification time of the zip archive to the modification time of the newest file inside the archive	
	- method CZipArchive::GetIndexes added
	- ZipArc application updated to support renaming, replacing (as well as updating files in the archive) and getting compressed files from another archive

 Changes: 
	- zlib library updated to version 1.1.4 that fixes the security vulnerability in version 1.1.3 
	as described in 
	
	http://www.zlib.org/advisory-2002-03-11.txt 
	
	- if the file inside the archive has the wrong date/time stamp set, then the extracted file is given the current time instead of reporting an error
	- a little change in CZipArchive::PredictFileNameInZip : parameter bAnsiOem changed to bExactly (apart from the name, the meaning has also been changed)
	- removed parameter bFileNameOnly from CZipArchive::DeleteFiles(const CZipStringArray &);

 Bugs fixed: 
	- eliminated possible errors when using CZipArchive::zipsmCheckForEff with disk-spanning mode
	- reading some files created with other archivers failed occasionally in CZipFileHeader::ReadLocal (thanks to Christian von Seydlitz)
	- while a file recompression (smartness level included CZipArchive::zipsmCheckForEff) if the
	AutoFlush feature was enabled, there were redundant bytes added to the archive (thanks to Roman Scherzer)
	- aborting extraction of multi-disk archive caused errors (thanks to Sabina Terenzi)
	- some GUI fixes in ZipArc

 Known issues: 
	- under Windows XP, in TD disk spanning mode, when the central directory is not entirely 
	written on the last volume (but divided between volumes), SHGetFileInfo hangs up (it is used i.e. by CFileDialog::DoModal) - Windows probably tries to analize 
	zip structure, but fails becuase it is an additional feature of ZipArchive library to create multi volume archives on non-removable data storage

 ver 2.2 (10-2001) Time for global changes

 Features added: 
	- deleting multiple files from the archive is now way faster - the files are not
	deleted separately as it was so far, but the library creates a map of holes and continuous areas and moves the data to remain in file over the holes; it means that the data is copied
	only once and not for every file to delete.
	- callback functions has been replaced by callback objects to make the code cleaner and to make it possible to pass more information during a callback call (see CZipArchive::SetCallback). The same application written using the library with callback functions
	and then with functional objects as callbacks (slightly modified) has proven to be circa 15% faster in the latter case (that's why it's in features), inter alia because only data that changes is passed to the callback method, method derived from CZipCallback::Callback can be inlined if defined inside the class declaration). Important issues:
		- it affects the following functions parameters:
			- CZipArchive::AddNewFile, 
			- CZipArchive::ExtractFile, 
			- CZipArchive::TestFile,
			- CZipArchive::SetSpanCallback
		- the meaning of the parameters passed to a callback objects is different from that what has so far been passed to the callback functions
		(see CZipCallback)
	- added callback feature when deleting files
	- added callback feature when saving central directory
	- added possibility to extract or delete files which filenames match the specified wildcard pattern (see CZipArchive::FindMatches)
	- iterating the central directory elements speeded up (hence all the operations that iterate the central directory were speeded up, especially sorting, multiple adding, extracting, testing)
	- the library now doesn't throw an exception if the platform the archive was created under is not supported, but it tries to distinguish files from directories
	- CZipArchive::Flush can be called now for a disk-spanning archive in creation finalizing it then, and yet allows extracting or testing (see the function description for more)
	- function CZipArchive::CloseNewFile can be called after an exception to allow to repair the archive later
	- adding files with one of CZipArchive::AddNewFile functions can be safely aborted in a non-disk-spanning archive (the added data is removed from the archive)
	- added function CZipException::GetErrorMessage for compatibility with MFC CException::GetErrorMessage
	- added parameter bForce to CZipArchive::SetTempPath that creates the directory if it doesn't exists
	- the archive created with the library under Windows can be now correctly extracted under Linux and vice versa without the need for setting the system compatibility of the files
	- function CZipArchive::SetIgnoreCRC added to make possible working with the Java TM Archives (jar)
	- function CZipArchive::GetFindFastIndex added
	- function CZipArchive::GetCentralDirInfo added
	- function CZipArchive::GetCentralDirSize added
	- function CZipArchive::GetCurrentDisk added
	- function CZipArchive::IsReadOnly added
	- function CZipFileHeader::CompressionEfficient added
	- function CZipFileHeader::GetCompressionRatio added
	- const keywords added to functions
	- TRACE messages are now easier to locate in MSVC++ (double clicking gets you directly to the code now)
	

 Changes: 
	- if the callback object's method Callback returns false,
	a CZipException is thrown with code CZipException::abortedAction or CZipException::abortedSafely;
	- function CZipArchive::DeleteFiles(const CZipStringArray) uses now FindFast array; added bFileNameOnly parameter
	- function CZipArchive::GetNoEntries renamed to GetCount (more standard, easier to type and easier to find at the beginning)
	- the encrypted file is not recompressed again if the difference in sizes before and after compression is the
	length of the encryption header
	- function CZipArchive::OpenFile throws exception CZipException::badPassword if the password
	was not set for the encrypted file instead of returning false;
	- versioning shortened

 Bugs fixed: 
	- CZipStorage::Flush doesn't call now m_pFile->Flush() (it has proven to slow 
	down the archive creation speed significantly) - it is called in different places instead 
	- CZipArchive::TestFile sometimes was not detecting wrong password set
	- filenames in zip are now correctly converted after calling CZipArchive::Flush
	- fixed value of CZipArchive::zipsmCheckForEffInMem; the bug cause the temporary file to be always created in memory
	- ZipPlatform::GetDeviceFreeSpace was not working on Windows with other devices than removable (in spite of what is written in MSDN
	it is sometimes needed to add slash when passing drive name to GetDiskFreeSpace and sometimes not).
	I'm not sure if this bug concerned all Windows platforms (it was detected on Windows 2000)
	- crash eliminated when the file modification time could not be retrieved (in case of an impossible value e.g. a year is 28980)
	- Unix attributes corrected
	- CZipArchive::ExtractFile had wrong value passed to the callback function

 ver 2.1.1 (10-2001)

	 Features added: 

		- Linux version at the beta stage (thanks to Luiz Rafael Culik for help)
		- smart and efficient compression added to CZipArchive::AddNewFile 
		inter alia optional compression to a temporary file first or to memory, in a disk spanning mode,
		to see whether the file	is smaller after compression and if it is not 
		then add it without the compression	(see also CZipArchive::Smartness)
		- integration of the help system with MSDN made possible 
		- adding a file with the user-specified filename in zip ( CZipArchive::AddNewFile(LPCTSTR , LPCTSTR , int , int , unsigned long ) )
		- adding files from memory and extracting files to memory 
		(	CZipArchive::AddNewFile(CZipMemFile&, LPCTSTR, int, int, unsigned long) and 
		CZipArchive::ExtractFile(WORD, CZipMemFile&, DWORD))
		- function CZipArchive::Flush added - increases the safety when working with zip archives (thanks to Brad Kremer for the idea)
		- function CZipArchive::SetCaseSensitivity added (see the function description which functions it affects)
		- function CZipArchive::PredictFileNameInZip added
		- function CZipArchive::PredictExtractedFileName added
		- function CZipArchive::FindFile speeded up again, the case-sensitivity parameter meaning changed, added possibility to find a filename only without a path (see the function description)
		- function CZipArchive::TrimRootPath function improved		
		- function CZipArchive::Close allows now to write the central directory to the archive even after exception, which lets you e.g. repair the archive later
		- obtaining error descriptions (English only) - see CZipException::GetErrorDescription()
		- STL sample application added (a command line archiver which works for both Windows and Linux; located in stl/zippie)
		- in TestZipDlg sample application added switch in options to allow an effective compression
		- several minor enhancements 

	 Changes: 

		- CZipPathComponent functions renamed : GetFullFileName -> GetFileName, GetFileName -> GetFileTitle, SetFileName -> SetFileTitle 
		- file __[...].zcfg is created depending on the current configuration when using scripts to copy files 

	 Bugs fixed: 

		- when performing a non-case-sensitive search with CZipArchive::FindFile (thanks to Kenny Prole)
		- in CZipString (STL) when using a different locale than English and 
		non-English characters 
		- CZipStorage::Flush call now m_pFile->Flush() as well (it might have caused a zip creation problems sometimes)

 ver 1.6.6 (08-2001)
