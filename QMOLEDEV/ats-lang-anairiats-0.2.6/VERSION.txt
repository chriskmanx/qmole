0.2.5

<pre>
ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.5:

1. Fixing a bug in handling call-by-reference. I was really surprised that
   the bug had not shown up earlier.
2. input_line_vt is added in prelude/filebas for returning a linear string
3. Fixing a bug in [valprim_is_mutable]: casting was incorrectly handled.
4. atslib_feof and atslib_ferror are changed to inlined functions (instead
   of macros). This is done to fix Cgwin's defining feof as a macro.
5. Some changes are made to support ATS on FreeBSD.
6. Fixing a bug involving linear closures (of the form <lin,cloptr>).
7. Adding support for if!: if! (e_cond, e_then, e_else) is for the
   following expression: (if e_cond then e_then else e_else).
8. Adding libats/funset_avltree to support (functional) sets.
9. The original *_clo and *_cloptr functions are renamed as *_vclo and
   *_vcloptr respectively, and the new *_clo and *_cloptr functions no
   longer require a (linear) proof argument.
10. [gc_stack_get_dir] is re-written to fix a bug triggered due to a form
    of over-optimization by gcc-4.6: a volatile function may get inlined.
    Kudos to Matthew for helping me on this one!
11. Fixing a bug that wrongly affected the exn-effect tracking.
12. Adding contrib/GLES2 to support OpenGL/ES2 binding. Thanks to Artyom!
13. Renaming: list_vt_*_clo -> list_vt_*_vclo. Also adding various functions:
    list_vt_*_cloptr and list_vt_*_vcloptr
14. Makefile_macosx is added for building ATS on MAC OS X. Thanks to Georg!

11. Adding some functions for parsing various syntax trees.
12. Renaming various 'get' and 'set' functions according to some adopted
    naming convention.

    Renaming: clo_tsz__main -> cloenv_tsz
    Renaming: __main -> _funenv (for various higher-order functions)
15: matrix_v (a, m, n, l) is now defined as mtrxt (a, m, n) @ l
16: stack-allocated closures are now statically allocated (instead of
    being dynamically allocated via alloca) (svn-version: 2519)

0.2.3

<pre>
ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.3:

As usual, this release contains a large number of fixes. There is
also a lot effort going into documentation. In particular, the grammar
of ATS (ats_grammar.yats) is cleaned considerably.

A (partial) list of the changes since the last release are given as
follows:

1. Adding READ: READ(string) is read-only!
2. Renaming prelude/?ATS/file.?ats to prelude/?ATS/filebas.?ats
3. Adding support -DATS flags: -DATSXYZ=12345 or -DATS XYZ=12345
4. Adding support for ATS/Anairiats to output #line pragma in the C code
   generated by atsopt.
5. Adding support for compiling fixed-point expressions (constructed via
   fix and @fix).
6. Introducing various macros in ccomp/runtime/ats_basics.h to give more
   structure to the C code generated by atsopt.
7. Introducing block expressions: { decseq_syn }
8. Supporting syndef-loaded external identifers
9. DO and WHILE are external ids: both while-loop and do-while-loop are
   supported.

15. "><" (GTLT) can now be used as a dynamic identifier.
16. Syntax like [val <pat> = <SomeProof>] is now ruled out: 'val' needs to be
    replaced with 'prval'.
17. Removing named types (S2Enamed), which is inadequate for its purpose
18. S2Eextype can now carry arguments
19. overhauling partial template implementation
20. ptrout -> vptrout and ptroutopt -> vptroutopt
21. ptropt_v -> optvar_v
22. [ptrself] is introduced as a named type of the name "ats_ptrself_type"

A (partial) list of the changes since the last release are given as
follows:

1. -D_ATS_TERMINATION_CHECK is changed to -D_ATS_PROOFCHECK; fixing a

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes. Also, many
new coding examples are added.

1. The support for 'atsopt --depgen' is revamped.
2. The support for boolean patterns is made available.
3. Most string-generating functions now return linear strings
   (strptr). This is a change that can have pervasive impact.
4. Some support for GMP/MPQ and GMP/MPF functions are added. See
   libc/SATS/gmp.sat for details.
5. Overhauling the ATS building system.

The following packages are available in ATS/libats:

genarrays.sats
hashtable_chain.sats
hashtable_linprb.sats
intinf.sats

0.2.0

<pre>
ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.0:

This is a milestone release. The original plan for OOP support in ATS has
been scratched completely, resulting in about 1500 lines of code being
removed. Instead, some support is added to interface ATS with external code
written in OOP-style.

The following libraries are now available for use:

contrib/glib
contrib/cairo
contrib/pango
contrib/X11
contrib/GTK
contrib/GL (OpenGL, GLU and GLUT)
contrib/SDL

Much more effort is needed to expand the APIs for these libraries. So far,
only the API for cairo is close to completion.
</pre>

######

0.1.9

<pre>
ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.9:

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes. The most notable
addition is a package named 'parworkshop' in $ATSHOME/libats, which
provides some rudimentary support for multicore programming (SMP).
Please see $ATSHOME/doc/EXAMPLE/MULTICORE for some examples.

(*
// this feature is retracted as it is difficult to support
1. overloaded symbols in a macro definition is re-loaded when the macro
   definition is expanded. This change can greatly facilitate the use of
   macros defined in $ATSHOME/prelude/macrodef.sats

2. macro expansion is now handled by [d1exp_tr] in [ats_trans2_dyn1.dats]
   (instead of being done by [d2exp_tr] in [ats_trans3_dyn2.dats])
*)

3. The semantics for symbol overloading is greatly simplified.
4. Adding libc/sched based on /usr/include/sched.x
5. Adding libats/parworkshop to support multicore programming.
6. The examples in doc/EXAMPLE/MULTICORE are modified to run again.
7. Adding support for lliunt and ullint.

......

$ATSHOME/contrib/SDL
</pre>

######

0.1.6

<pre>
ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.6:

As usual, this release contains a large number of bug fixes. Some of the
significant changes are listed as follows:

1. Support for OOP is under development. So far, typechecking is done.
2. Type error message reporting is made more informative. This is ongoing.
3. Adding $ATSHOME/ccomp/lib64 for storing libfiles for 64-bit machines.
4. The Makefile in $ATSHOME is re-designed by Likai Liu. It now allows
   ATS to be installed in a selected directory. Just issue the following
   command before calling 'make':

./configure --prefix=&lt;DESTDIR&gt;

   where &lt;DESTDIR&gt; is the directory for final installation. After 'make'
   is done, please call 'make install'.
