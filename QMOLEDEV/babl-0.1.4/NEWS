2011-01-20 babl-0.1.4                                               </dt><dd>
Improved cross platform build ability, added code to handle n-component formats,
remove extraenous runtime profiling that impacted performance.

                                                                    </dd><dt>

Made babl mostly threadsafe (sufficient for GIMP/GEGLs needs). Streamlined core functionality, reducing number of function calls and removing overeager instrumentation.
                                                                    </dd><dt>
2009-05-20 babl-0.1.0                                               </dt><dd>
Support for RGBA representation in the frequency domain,
un-pre-multiply close-to-zero alpha values to complete black instead
of slightly brighter than black, add a BABL_ALPHA_THRESHOLD constant
to the API, do a complete overhaul of the babl API and do some
changes to increase portability of the library.
                                                                    </dd><dt>

Speed improvements due to: coalesced hashing, early bail out upon creation of
duplicate formats, caching of non existing paths. Large amounts of the core has
also been reviewed and refactored. Improved conversion coverage in the matrix.
                                                                    </dd><dt>

Builds on OSX
Check <0.0 and >1.0 values conversions for accuracy as well.
