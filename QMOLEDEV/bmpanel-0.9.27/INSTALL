INSTALL -------

Simple build & install (as not root user and with sudo installed, or
simply run as root without sudo):

./configure && sudo make install

Will install bmpanel to /usr/bin/bmpanel and themes to
/usr/share/bmpanel/themes.  If you don't like default prefix for
install, you can specify it like this:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local && sudo make install

for debug build use:

./configure --debug && sudo make install

RUNNING -------

Simply run:

bmpanel <theme>

where <theme> is one of built-in themes or separate downloaded theme.

BMPanel have no config files, it uses theme files instead. BMPanel
will search for themes in following places in following order:

1. ~/.bmpanel/themes/<theme> 2. PREFIX/share/bmpanel/themes/<theme>
(default: /usr/share/bmpanel/themes/<theme>) 3. <theme> (if you use
absolute path)

You might want to run bmpanel in background. For example with native
theme:

bmpanel native &

Don't bother to use themes as config. Just copy one of
PREFIX/share/bmpanel/themes to your ~/.bmpanel/themes dir and change
them as you want.
