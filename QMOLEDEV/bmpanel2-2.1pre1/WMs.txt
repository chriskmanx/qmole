Info about WMs (discovered during testing)

1. Openbox 
I'm developing bmpanel2 on this WM. It has a good conformance to the NETWM
standard. Everything works.

2. Compiz + Emerald (standalone)
Works somewhat. But for example this WM changes _NET_CLIENT_LIST every time
desktop is being switched. Are developers too lazy to read standard?

3. IceWM
Looks like everything works.

4. PekWM
Looks like everything works.

5. Fluxbox
Looks like it works.

6. Xfwm4
Looks like it works now.
