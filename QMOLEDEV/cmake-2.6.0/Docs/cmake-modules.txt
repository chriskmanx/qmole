cmake version 2.6-patch 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description

The "cmake" executable is the CMake command-line interface.  It may be used
to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option.  The -i option will cause
cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their
build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users build a
project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their
platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard CMake Modules

The following modules are provided with CMake.  They can be used with
INCLUDE(ModuleName).

  CMake Modules - Modules coming with CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.

This is the documentation for the modules and scripts coming with CMake.
Using these modules you can check the computer system for installed software
packages, features of the compiler and the existance of headers to name just
a few.

  AddFileDependencies
       ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file depend_files...)

       Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file


  CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX
       define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

         CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++ 
         CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has <strstream>
         INCLUDE(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
         INCLUDE(CheckIncludeFileCXX)
         INCLUDE(TestForSTDNamespace)
         INCLUDE(TestForANSIForScope)


  CMakeDependentOption
       Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

       This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other
       conditions are true.  When the option is not presented a default value
       is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the
       option is presented again.  Example invocation:

         CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON
                                "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)

       If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option
       called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to
       OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for
       the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re-enabled it
       retains its old value.

  CMakeDetermineASM-ATTCompiler
        

       determine the compiler to use for ASM using AT&T syntax

  CMakeDetermineASMCompiler
        

       determine the compiler to use for ASM programs

  CMakeExportBuildSettings
       export build settings from a project.

         CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_SETTINGS(SETTINGS_FILE)

       macro defined to export the build settings for use by another project.

         SETTINGS_FILE - the file into which the settings are to be stored.


  CMakeFindFrameworks
       helper module to find OSX frameworks

  CMakeForceCompiler
        

       This module defines macros intended for use by cross-compiling
       toolchain files when CMake is not able to automatically detect the
       compiler identification.

       Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following signature:

          CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

       It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal
       variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id.  It also
       bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information
       tests.

       Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following signature:

          CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

       It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake
       internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id.  It
       also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler
       information tests.

       So a simple toolchain file could look like this:

          INCLUDE (CMakeForceCompiler)
          SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
          CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
          CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)


  CMakeImportBuildSettings
       import build settings from another project

         CMAKE_IMPORT_BUILD_SETTINGS(SETTINGS_FILE) 

       macro defined to import the build settings from another project.
       SETTINGS_FILE is a file created by the other project's call to the
       CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_SETTINGS macro, see CMakeExportBuildSettings.

  CMakeJavaInformation
        

       This should be included before the _INIT variables are used to
       initialize the cache.  Since the rule variables have if blocks on
       them, users can still define them here.  But, it should still be after
       the platform file so changes can be made to those values.

  CMakePrintSystemInformation
       print system information

       This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just include it in a
       project to see various internal CMake variables.

  CPack
        

       Default output files will be CPackConfig.cmake and
       CPackSourceConfig.cmake.  This can be overwritten with
       CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE and CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE.

  CPackRPM
        

       CPack script for creating RPM package Author: Eric Noulard with the

         INCLUDE(CTest)
         IF(BUILD_TESTING)
           # ... testing related CMake code ...
         ENDIF(BUILD_TESTING)

       The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the CTest module to determine
       whether testing support should be enabled.  The default is ON.

  CTestTestfile
        

       CMake generated Testfile for Source directory:
       /home/chris/cmake-2.6.0/Modules Build directory:
       /home/chris/cmake-2.6.0/Modules

       This file replicates the SUBDIRS() and ADD_TEST() commands from the

  Dart
       Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client

       This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest module.
       It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard
       submissions as well as testing with CTest.  This module should be
       included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project.  Typical
       usage:

         INCLUDE(Dart)
         IF(BUILD_TESTING)
           # ... testing related CMake code ...
         ENDIF(BUILD_TESTING)

       The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine
       whether testing support should be enabled.  The default is ON.

  Documentation
       DocumentationVTK.cmake

       This file provides support for the VTK documentation framework.  It
       relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl, etc).

  FeatureSummary
       Macros for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features

       

       PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES()

          Print a summary of all enabled features. By default all successfull
          FIND_PACKAGE() calls will appear here, except the ones which used the QUIET keyword.
          Additional features can be added by appending an entry to the global ENABLED_FEATURES
          property. If SET_FEATURE_INFO() is used for that feature, the output will be much 
          more informative.

       

       PRINT_DISABLED_FEATURES()

          Same as PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES(), but for disabled features. It can be extended
          the same way by adding to the global property DISABLED_FEATURES.

       

       SET_FEATURE_INFO(NAME DESCRIPTION [URL [COMMENT] ] )

           Use this macro to set up information about the named feature, which will
           then be displayed by PRINT_ENABLED/DISABLED_FEATURES().
           Example: SET_FEATURE_INFO(LibXml2 "XML processing library." "http://xmlsoft.org/")

       


  FindASPELL
       Try to find ASPELL

       Once done this will define

         ASPELL_FOUND - system has ASPELL
         ASPELL_INCLUDE_DIR - the ASPELL include directory
         ASPELL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use ASPELL
         ASPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using ASPELL


  FindAVIFile
       Locate AVIFILE library and include paths

       AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/)is a set of libraries for
       i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.  Support is limited beyond
       Linux.  Windows provides native AVI support, and so doesn't need this
       library.  This module defines

         AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
         AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
         AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
         AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, don't try to use AVIFILE


  FindBLAS
       Find BLAS library

       This module finds an installed fortran library that implements the
       BLAS linear-algebra interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/).  The
       list of libraries searched for is taken from the autoconf macro file,
       acx_blas.m4 (distributed at
       http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).

       This module sets the following variables:

         BLAS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS interface
           is found
         BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of required linker flags (excluding -l
           and -L).
         BLAS_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to 
           link against to use BLAS
         BLAS95_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) # to link against to use BLAS95 interface

       


  FindBZip2
       Try to find BZip2

       Once done this will define

         BZIP2_FOUND - system has BZip2
         BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR - the BZip2 include directory
         BZIP2_LIBRARIES - Link these to use BZip2
         BZIP2_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using BZip2
         BZIP2_NEED_PREFIX - this is set if the functions are prefixed with BZ2_


  FindBoost
       Try to find Boost include dirs and libraries

       Usage of this module as follows:

            SET(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
            SET(Boost_USE_MULTITHREAD OFF)
            FIND_PACKAGE( Boost 1.34.1 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem iostreams ... )

       

       The Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list
       of boost version numbers that should be taken into account when
       searching for the libraries.  Unfortunately boost puts the version
       number into the actual filename for the libraries, so this might be
       needed in the future when new Boost versions are released.

       Currently this module searches for the following version numbers:
       1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1,
       1.36.0, 1.36.1

       The components list needs to be the actual names of boost libraries,
       that is the part of the actual library files that differ on different
       libraries.  So its "date_time" for "libboost_date_time...".  Anything
       else will result in errors

       You can provide a minimum version number that should be used.  If you
       provide this version number and specify the REQUIRED attribute, this
       module will fail if it can't find the specified or a later version.
       If you specify a version number this is automatically put into the
       considered list of version numbers and thus doesn't need to be
       specified in the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable

       Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour
       and need to be set before calling find_package:

         Boost_USE_MULTITHREAD         Can be set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded
                                       boost libraries. Defaults to ON.
         Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS         Can be set to ON to force the use of the static
                                       boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.
         Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS     A list of version numbers to use for searching
                                       the boost include directory. The default list

       KDE3_AUTOMOC(file1 ...  fileN)

           Call this if you want to have automatic moc file handling.
           This means if you include "foo.moc" in the source file foo.cpp
           a moc file for the header foo.h will be created automatically.
           You can set the property SKIP_AUTOMAKE using SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES()
           to exclude some files in the list from being processed.

       

       KDE3_ADD_MOC_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1 ...  fileN )

           If you don't use the KDE3_AUTOMOC() macro, for the files
           listed here moc files will be created (named "foo.moc.cpp")

       

       KDE3_ADD_DCOP_SKELS(SRCS_VAR header1.h ...  headerN.h )

           Use this to generate DCOP skeletions from the listed headers.

       

       KDE3_ADD_DCOP_STUBS(SRCS_VAR header1.h ...  headerN.h )

            Use this to generate DCOP stubs from the listed headers.

       

       KDE3_ADD_UI_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1.ui ...  fileN.ui )

           Use this to add the Qt designer ui files to your application/library.

       

       KDE3_ADD_KCFG_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1.kcfgc ...  fileN.kcfgc )

           Use this to add KDE kconfig compiler files to your application/library.

       

       KDE3_INSTALL_LIBTOOL_FILE(target)

           This will create and install a simple libtool file for the given target.

       

       KDE3_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name file1 ...  fileN )

           Currently identical to ADD_EXECUTABLE(), may provide some advanced features in the future.

       

       KDE3_ADD_KPART(name [WITH_PREFIX] file1 ...  fileN )

           Create a KDE plugin (KPart, kioslave, etc.) from the given source files.
           If WITH_PREFIX is given, the resulting plugin will have the prefix "lib", otherwise it won't.
           It creates and installs an appropriate libtool la-file.

       

       KDE3_ADD_KDEINIT_EXECUTABLE(name file1 ...  fileN )

           Create a KDE application in the form of a module loadable via kdeinit.
           A library named kdeinit_<name> will be created and a small executable which links to it.

       

       The option KDE3_ENABLE_FINAL to enable all-in-one compilation is no
       longer supported.

  FindMPI
       Message Passing Interface (MPI) module.

       

       The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to write
       high-performance parallel applications that use message passing, and
       is typically deployed on a cluster.  MPI is a standard interface
       (defined by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are
       available.  All of these implementations have somewhat different
       compilation approaches (different include paths, libraries to link
       against, etc.), and this module tries to smooth out those differences.

       This module will set the following variables:

          MPI_FOUND                  TRUE if we have found MPI
          MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS          Compilation flags for MPI programs
          MPI_INCLUDE_PATH           Include path(s) for MPI header
          MPI_LINK_FLAGS             Linking flags for MPI programs
          MPI_LIBRARY                First MPI library to link against (cached)
          MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY          Extra MPI libraries to link against (cached)
          MPI_LIBRARIES              All libraries to link MPI programs against
          MPIEXEC                    Executable for running MPI programs
          MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG       Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving it the
                                     number of processors to run on
          MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS           Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly before the
                                     executable to run.
          MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS          Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after all other flags.

       

       This module will attempt to auto-detect these settings, first by
       looking for a MPI compiler, which many MPI implementations provide as
       a pass-through to the native compiler to simplify the compilation of
       MPI programs.  The MPI compiler is stored in the cache variable
       MPI_COMPILER, and will attempt to look for commonly-named drivers
       mpic++, mpicxx, mpiCC, or mpicc.  If the compiler driver is found and
       recognized, it will be used to set all of the module variables.  To
       skip this auto-detection, set MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_INCLUDE_PATH in the
       CMake cache.

       If no compiler driver is found or the compiler driver is not
       recognized, this module will then search for common include paths and
       library names to try to detect MPI.

       If CMake initially finds a different MPI than was intended, and you
       want to use the MPI compiler auto-detection for a different MPI
       implementation, set MPI_COMPILER to the MPI compiler driver you want
       to use (e.g., mpicxx) and then set MPI_LIBRARY to the string
       MPI_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND.  When you re-configure, auto-detection of MPI
       will run again with the newly-specified MPI_COMPILER.

       When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you should typically
       use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:

          ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE
            ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS

       where PROCS is the number of processors on which to execute the
       program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments to
       pass to the MPI program.

  FindMatlab
       this module looks for Matlab

       Locate OpenAL This module defines OPENAL_LIBRARY OPENAL_FOUND, if
       false, do not try to link to OpenAL OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find
       the headers

       $OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR used in building OpenAL.

         OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR  - the GL include directory
         OPENGL_LIBRARIES    - Link these to use OpenGL and GLU
          

       If you want to use just GL you can use these values

         OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY   - Path to OpenGL Library
         OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY  - Path to GLU Library
         

       On OSX default to using the framework version of opengl People will

       OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with X11 on OSX

  FindOpenSSL
       Try to find the OpenSSL encryption library

       Once done this will define

         OPENSSL_FOUND - system has the OpenSSL library
         OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR - the OpenSSL include directory
         OPENSSL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use OpenSSL


  FindOpenThreads
        

       OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library.  Its largest userbase
       seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an
       environment path.  I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to
       find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you
       must opt in to each module.

       Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY
       OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads
       OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers

       $OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to
       the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

       the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         PHP4_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where php.h can be found
         PHP4_EXECUTABLE         = full path to the php4 binary

       


  FindPNG
       Find the native PNG includes and library

       

       This module defines

         PNG_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find png.h, etc.
         PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.
         PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should ADD_DEFINITONS(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code that includes png library files.
         PNG_FOUND, If false, do not try to use PNG.

       also defined, but not for general use are

         PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.

       None of the above will be defined unles zlib can be found.  PNG
       depends on Zlib

  FindPackageHandleStandardArgs
        

       FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME (DEFAULT_MSG|"Custom failure
       message") VAR1 ...  )

           This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.
           It handles the REQUIRED and QUIET argument to FIND_PACKAGE() and
           it also sets the <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND variable.
           The package is found if all variables listed are TRUE.
           Example:

       

           FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG LIBXML2_LIBRARIES LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)

       

           LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARIES and 
           LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE.
           If it is not found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, 
           independent whether QUIET was used or not.
           If it is found, the location is reported using the VAR1 argument, so 
           here a message "Found LibXml2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so" will be printed out.
           If the second argument is DEFAULT_MSG, the message in the failure case will 
           be "Could NOT find LibXml2", if you don't like this message you can specify
           your own custom failure message there.


  FindPackageMessage
        

       FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(<name> "message for user" "find result details")

       This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.  It
       will print a message once for each unique find result.  This is useful
       for telling the user where a package was found.  The first argument
       specifies the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument
       specifies the message to display.  The third argument lists details
       about the find result so that if they change the message will be
       displayed again.  The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the
       find_package command.

       Example:

         IF(X11_FOUND)
           FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 "Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}"
             "[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]")
         ELSE(X11_FOUND)
          ...
         ENDIF(X11_FOUND)


  FindPerl
       Find perl

       this module looks for Perl

         PERL_EXECUTABLE - the full path to perl
         PERL_FOUND      - If false, don't attempt to use perl.


  FindPerlLibs
       Find Perl libraries

       This module finds if PERL is installed and determines where the
       include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
       the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         PERL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where perl.h is found
         PERL_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the perl binary

       


  FindPhysFS
        

       Locate PhysFS library This module defines PHYSFS_LIBRARY, the name of
       the library to link against PHYSFS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link
       to PHYSFS PHYSFS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find physfs.h

       $PHYSFSDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$PHYSFSDIR used in building PHYSFS.

       Created by Eric Wing.

  FindPike
       Find Pike

       This module finds if PIKE is installed and determines where the
       include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
       the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where program.h is found
         PIKE_EXECUTABLE         = full path to the pike binary

       


  FindPkgConfig
       a pkg-config module for CMake

       

       Usage:

          pkg_check_modules(<PREFIX> [REQUIRED] <MODULE> [<MODULE>]*)
            checks for all the given modules

       

          pkg_search_module(<PREFIX> [REQUIRED] <MODULE> [<MODULE>]*)
            checks for given modules and uses the first working one

       

       When the 'REQUIRED' argument was set, macros will fail with an error
       when module(s) could not be found

       It sets the following variables:

          PKG_CONFIG_FOUND         ... true if pkg-config works on the system
          PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE    ... pathname of the pkg-config program
          <PREFIX>_FOUND           ... set to 1 if module(s) exist

       

       For the following variables two sets of values exist; first one is the
       common one and has the given PREFIX.  The second set contains flags
       which are given out when pkgconfig was called with the '--static'
       option.

          <XPREFIX>_LIBRARIES      ... only the libraries (w/o the '-l')
          <XPREFIX>_LIBRARY_DIRS   ... the paths of the libraries (w/o the '-L')
          <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS        ... all required linker flags
          <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS_OTHER  ... all other linker flags
          <XPREFIX>_INCLUDE_DIRS   ... the '-I' preprocessor flags (w/o the '-I')
          <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS         ... all required cflags
          <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS_OTHER   ... the other compiler flags

       

          <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>        for common case
          <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>_STATIC for static linking

       

       There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the count of
       given modules.  When there is only one module, <PREFIX> stays
       unchanged.  When there are multiple modules, the prefix will be
       changed to <PREFIX>_<MODNAME>:

          <XPREFIX>_VERSION    ... version of the module
          <XPREFIX>_PREFIX     ... prefix-directory of the module
          <XPREFIX>_INCLUDEDIR ... include-dir of the module
          <XPREFIX>_LIBDIR     ... lib-dir of the module

       

          <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>  when |MODULES| == 1, else
          <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>_<MODNAME>

       

       A <MODULE> parameter can have the following formats:

          {MODNAME}            ... matches any version
          {MODNAME}>={VERSION} ... at least version <VERSION> is required
          {MODNAME}={VERSION}  ... exactly version <VERSION> is required
          {MODNAME}<={VERSION} ... modules must not be newer than <VERSION>

       

       Examples

          pkg_check_modules (GLIB2   glib-2.0)

       

          pkg_check_modules (GLIB2   glib-2.0>=2.10)
            requires at least version 2.10 of glib2 and defines e.g.
              GLIB2_VERSION=2.10.3

       

          pkg_check_modules (FOO     glib-2.0>=2.10 gtk+-2.0)
            requires both glib2 and gtk2, and defines e.g.
              FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION=2.10.3
              FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION=2.8.20

       

          pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender)
            defines e.g.:
              XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
              XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp

  FindProducer
        

       Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary
       user is OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find
       OpenSceneGraph components.  You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an
       environment path.

       Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You
       must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do
       it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece
       by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change
       the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default
       FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example).
       If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything,
       use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake
       modules.

       Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY PRODUCER_FOUND,
       if false, do not try to link to Producer PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where
       to find the headers

       $PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.

  FindPythonInterp
       Find python interpreter

       This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and determines
       where the executables are.  This code sets the following variables:

         PYTHONINTERP_FOUND - Was the Python executable found
         PYTHON_EXECUTABLE  - path to the Python interpreter

       


  FindPythonLibs
       Find python libraries

       This module finds if Python is installed and determines where the
       include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
       the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         PYTHONLIBS_FOUND     = have the Python libs been found
         PYTHON_LIBRARIES     = path to the python library
         PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH  = path to where Python.h is found
         PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES = path to the debug library

       


  FindQt
       Searches for all installed versions of QT.

       This should only be used if your project can work with multiple
       versions of QT.  If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or
       FindQt3.  If multiple versions of QT are found on the machine, then
       The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they
       want to use.  If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then
       the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3
       or FindQt4 module is included.  Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION,
       then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.

         QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can 
                     not find QT4 or QT3 an error is raised 
                     and a message is sent to the user.

       

         DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created
         QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
         QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.


  FindQt3

                          compiling code that uses Qt.
         QT_FOUND       - If false, don't try to use Qt.

       

       If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to
       TRUE

       Also defined, but not for general use are:

          library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.


  FindQt4
       Find QT 4

       This module can be used to find Qt4.  The most important issue is that
       the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path.  This qmake is then
       used to detect basically everything else.  This module defines a
       number of key variables and macros.  First is QT_USE_FILE which is the
       path to a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4 applications
       and libraries.  By default, the QtCore and QtGui libraries are loaded.
       This behavior can be changed by setting one or more of the following
       variables to true before doing INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE}):

                           QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE
                           QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI
                           QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT
                           QT_USE_QTASSISTANT
                           QT_USE_QTDESIGNER
                           QT_USE_QTMOTIF
                           QT_USE_QTMAIN
                           QT_USE_QTNETWORK
                           QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN
                           QT_USE_QTOPENGL
                           QT_USE_QTSQL
                           QT_USE_QTXML
                           QT_USE_QTSVG
                           QT_USE_QTTEST
                           QT_USE_QTUITOOLS
                           QT_USE_QTDBUS
                           QT_USE_QTSCRIPT
                           QT_USE_QTASSISTANTCLIENT
                           QT_USE_QTHELP
                           QT_USE_QTWEBKIT
                           QT_USE_QTXMLPATTERNS
                           QT_USE_PHONON

       

       The file pointed to by QT_USE_FILE will set up your compile
       environment by adding include directories, preprocessor defines, and
       populate a QT_LIBRARIES variable containing all the Qt libraries and
       their dependencies.  Add the QT_LIBRARIES variable to your
       TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES.

       Typical usage could be something like:

          FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
          SET(QT_USE_QTXML 1)
          INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})
          ADD_EXECUTABLE(myexe main.cpp)
          TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})

       

       

       There are also some files that need processing by some Qt tools such
       as moc and uic.  Listed below are macros that may be used to process
       those files.

         
         macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
               create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
               the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Options may be given to moc, such as those found
               when executing "moc -help"

       

         macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
               create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
               Options may be given to uic, such as those found
               when executing "uic -help"

       

         macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
               create code from a list of Qt resource files.
               Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
               when executing "rcc -help"

       

         macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile )
               creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
               Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
               because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.

       

         macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )
               This macro is still experimental.
               It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
               So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a 
               a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
               want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
               #include "foo.moc"
               in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the
               scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it finds
               them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the 
               accompanying header file foo.h.
               If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this macro.

       

         macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)
               create a the interface header and implementation files with the 
               given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to 
               the list of sources

       

         macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
               create the interface header and implementation files 
               for all listed interface xml files
               the name will be automatically determined from the name of the xml file

       

         macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname [basename] )
               create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
               describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
               forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
               parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
               <basename>adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename is the basename of the xml file.

       

         macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] )
               generate the xml interface file from the given header.
               If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the 
               interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
               the suffix .xml appended.

       

         macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files sources ... ts_files ... )
               out: qm_files
               in:  sources ts_files
               generates commands to create .ts (vie lupdate) and .qm
               (via lrelease) - files from sources. The ts files are 
               created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
               The qm files are generated in the build tree.
               Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
               to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
               always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
               they get updated/generated.

       

         macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... )
               out: qm_files
               in:  ts_files
               generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated
               filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files
               must exists and are not updated in any way.

                          The QT_USE_FILE will also define QT_DEBUG and QT_NO_DEBUG
                          to fit your current build type.  Those are not contained

       The Qt toolkit may contain both debug and release libraries.  In that
       case, the following library variables will contain both.  You do not
       need to use these variables if you include QT_USE_FILE, and use

         QT_MT_REQUIRED         Qt4 is now always multithreaded
         

       These variables are set to "" Because Qt structure changed (They make
       no sense in Qt4)

         QT_QT_LIBRARY        Qt-Library is now split


  FindQuickTime
        

       Locate QuickTime This module defines QUICKTIME_LIBRARY
       QUICKTIME_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to gdal
       QUICKTIME_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers

       $QUICKTIME_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$QUICKTIME_DIR

       Created by Eric Wing.

  FindRuby
       Find Ruby

       This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines where the
       include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
       the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where ruby.h can be found
         RUBY_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the ruby binary
         RUBY_LIBRARY      = full path to the ruby library


  FindSDL
        

       Locate SDL library This module defines SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the
       library to link against SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
       SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h

       This module responds to the the flag: SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this is
       defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because only applications
       need main().  Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application
       and this module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link
       flags as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.

       Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
       OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
       this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
       module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.

       

       Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
       configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
       library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set
       SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
       Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
       value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
       SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY
       does not get created.

       

       $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.  l.e.galup 9-20-02

       Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
       by using environmental variables and providing a more
       controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
       recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
       Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
       guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
       platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
       platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.

       On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
       People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
       override this selection or set the CMake environment
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

       Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
       This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
       "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
       because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

       Locate SDL_image library This module defines SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY, the
       name of the library to link against SDLIMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not
       try to link to SDL SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h

       $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

  FindSWIG
       Find SWIG

       This module finds an installed SWIG.  It sets the following variables:

         SWIG_FOUND - set to true if SWIG is found
         SWIG_DIR - the directory where swig is installed
         SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path to the swig executable
         SWIG_VERSION   - the version number of the swig executable

       

       All informations are collected from the SWIG_EXECUTABLE so the version
       to be found can be changed from the command line by means of setting
       SWIG_EXECUTABLE


  FindSelfPackers
       Find upx

       This module looks for some executable packers (i.e.  softwares that
       compress executables or shared libs into on-the-fly self-extracting
       executables or shared libs.  Examples:

         UPX: http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html


  FindSubversion
       Extract information from a subversion working copy

       The module defines the following variables:

         Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line client
         Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line client
         Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client was found

       If the command line client executable is found the macro

         Subversion_WC_INFO(<dir> <var-prefix>)

       is defined to extract information of a subversion working copy at a
       given location.  The macro defines the following variables:

         <var-prefix>_WC_URL - url of the repository (at <dir>)
         <var-prefix>_WC_ROOT - root url of the repository
         <var-prefix>_WC_REVISION - current revision
         <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last commit
         <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of last commit
         <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV - revision of last commit
         <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base revision
         <var-prefix>_WC_INFO - output of command `svn info <dir>'

       Example usage:

         FIND_PACKAGE(Subversion)
         IF(Subversion_FOUND)
           Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
           MESSAGE("Current revision is ${Project_WC_REVISION}")
         ENDIF(Subversion_FOUND)


  FindTCL
       TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.

       This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines where the include
       files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
       library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
         TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
         TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
         TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
         TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
         TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
         TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
         TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
         TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable

       

       In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for
       people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some
       variables were moved or removed.  Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:

          => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
          => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions. 
             Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
             are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
             specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). 
             Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign 
             TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
          => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
             confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
             tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
             this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
             and dig from there.


  FindTIFF
       Find TIFF library

       Find the native TIFF includes and library This module defines

         TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find tiff.h, etc.
         TIFF_LIBRARIES, libraries to link against to use TIFF.
         TIFF_FOUND, If false, do not try to use TIFF.

       also defined, but not for general use are

         TIFF_LIBRARY, where to find the TIFF library.


  FindTclStub
       TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.

       This module finds Tcl stub libraries.  It first finds Tcl include
       files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake.  How to Use the Tcl
       Stubs Library:

          http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html

       Using Stub Libraries:

          http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3

       This code sets the following variables:

         TCL_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to Tcl stub library
         TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library

       

       In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for

             Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign 
             TCL_STUB_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.


  FindTclsh
       Find tclsh

       This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include
       files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
       library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         TCLSH_FOUND = TRUE if tclsh has been found
         TCL_TCLSH = the path to the tclsh executable

       In cygwin, look for the cygwin version first.  Don't look for it later
       to avoid finding the cygwin version on a Win32 build.

  FindThreads
       This module determines the thread library of the system.

       The following variables are set

         CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT     - the thread library
         CMAKE_USE_SPROC_INIT       - are we using sproc?
         CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
         CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT    - are we using pthreads

       The following variables are set if VTK is found.  If VTK is not found,
       VTK_FOUND is set to false.

         VTK_FOUND         - Set to true when VTK is found.
         VTK_USE_FILE      - CMake file to use VTK.
         VTK_MAJOR_VERSION - The VTK major version number.
         VTK_MINOR_VERSION - The VTK minor version number 
                              (odd non-release).
         VTK_BUILD_VERSION - The VTK patch level 
                              (meaningless for odd minor).
         VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Include directories for VTK
         VTK_LIBRARY_DIRS  - Link directories for VTK libraries
         VTK_KITS          - List of VTK kits, in CAPS 
                             (COMMON,IO,) etc.
         VTK_LANGUAGES     - List of wrapped languages, in CAPS
                             (TCL, PYHTON,) etc.

       The following cache entries must be set by the user to locate VTK:

         VTK_DIR  - The directory containing VTKConfig.cmake.  
                    This is either the root of the build tree,
                    or the lib/vtk directory.  This is the 
                    only cache entry.

       The following variables are set for backward compatibility and should
       not be used in new code:

         USE_VTK_FILE - The full path to the UseVTK.cmake file.
                        This is provided for backward 
                        compatibility.  Use VTK_USE_FILE 
                        instead.

       


  FindWget
       Find wget

       This module looks for wget.  This module defines the following values:

         WGET_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the wget tool.

  FindWish
       Find wish installation

       This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include
       files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
       library is.  This code sets the following variables:

         TK_WISH = the path to the wish executable

       

       if UNIX is defined, then it will look for the cygwin version first

  Findosg
        

       This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
       components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
       module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
       if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
       control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
       out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
       module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't
       work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more
       convenient module that includes everything, use the
       FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

       Locate osg This module defines OSG_LIBRARY OSG_FOUND, if false, do not
       try to link to osg OSG_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers

       $OSGDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
       ./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.

  FindosgIntrospection
        

       This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
       components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
       module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
       if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
       control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
       out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
       module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't

  FindwxWidgets
       Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.

       This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default
       configuration to use.  wxWidgets is a modular library.  To specify the
       modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the
       package:

       FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS base core ...)

       There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style.  For
       windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults
       in case of multiple choices.  Change them if the defaults are not
       desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to
       select a configuration):

         wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      - Base wxWidgets directory
                                   (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3).
         wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       - Path to wxWidgets libraries
                                   (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
         wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use
                                   (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)

       

       For unix style it uses the wx-config utility.  You can select between
       debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non-universal, and
       static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF
       the following variables:

         wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
         wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
         wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
         wxWidgets_USE_STATIC
         

       The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows
       and unix style:

         wxWidgets_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
         wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Include directories for WIN32
                                      i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                                      "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
         wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
         wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link dirs, useful for
                                      rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                                      in WIN32 environment.
         wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      - Contains defines required to compile/link
                                      against WX, e.g. -DWXUSINGDLL
         wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        - Include dirs and ompiler flags for
                                      unices, empty on WIN32. Esentially
                                      "`wx-config --cxxflags`".
         wxWidgets_USE_FILE         - Convenience include file.

       

       Sample usage:

          FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS base core gl net)
          IF(wxWidgets_FOUND)
            INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
            # and for each of your dependant executable/library targets:
            TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
          ENDIF(wxWidgets_FOUND)

       

       If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):

          FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets REQUIRED base core gl net)
          INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
          # and for each of your dependant executable/library targets:
          TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})


  FindwxWindows
       Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

       This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed and determines
       where the include files and libraries are.  It also determines what
       the name of the library is.  Please note this file is DEPRECATED and
       replaced by FindwxWidgets.cmake.  This code sets the following
       variables:

         WXWINDOWS_FOUND     = system has WxWindows
         WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries
                               on Unix/Linux with additional
                               linker flags from
                               "wx-config --libs"
         CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS  = Compiler flags for wxWindows,
                                      essentially "`wx-config --cxxflags`"
                                      on Linux
         WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR      = where to find "wx/wx.h" and "wx/setup.h"
         WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on
                                       Unix
         WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS      = extra defines

       

       OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please

         SET(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

       in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this file.

         HAVE_ISYSTEM      - true required to replace -I by -isystem on g++

       

       For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your project's
       CMakeLists.txt using INCLUDE(Use_wxWindows).

       GetPrerequisites.cmake

       This script provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files
       that an executable or shared library file depends on.  (Its
       prerequisites.)

       It uses various tools to obtain the list of required shared library
       files:

          dumpbin (Windows)
          ldd (Linux/Unix)
          otool (Mac OSX)

       

       The following functions are provided by this script:

          gp_append_unique
          gp_file_type
          is_file_executable
          get_prerequisites
          list_prerequisites

       

       Requires CMake 2.5 or greater because it uses function, break, return
       and PARENT_SCOPE.

  InstallRequiredSystemLibraries
        

       By including this file, all files in the
       CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, will be installed with INSTALL_PROGRAMS
       into /bin for WIN32 and /lib for non-win32.  If
       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES is set to TRUE before including this file,
       then the INSTALL command is not called.  The use can use the variable
       CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install command and
       install them into any directory they want.  If it is the MSVC
       compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be found add
       automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, and
       installed.  If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC
       compiler, then the debug libraries are installed when available.  If
       CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are
       installed as well as the CRT run time libraries.

          SWIG_ADD_MODULE(name language [ files ])
            - Define swig module with given name and specified language
          SWIG_LINK_LIBRARIES(name [ libraries ])
            - Link libraries to swig module

       All other macros are for internal use only.  To get the actual name of
       the swig module, use: ${SWIG_MODULE_name_REAL_NAME}.  Set Source files
       properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify special
       behavior of SWIG.  Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can be used to add
       special flags to all swig calls.  Another special variable is
       CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify where to write all the
       swig generated module (swig -outdir option) The name-specific variable
       SWIG_MODULE_<name>_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify extra
       dependencies for the generated modules.

  Use_wxWindows
       ---------------------------------------------------

       

       This convenience include finds if wxWindows is installed and set the
       appropriate libs, incdirs, flags etc.  author Jan Woetzel <jw -at-
       mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de> (07/2003)

       USAGE:

          just include Use_wxWindows.cmake
          in your projects CMakeLists.txt

       INCLUDE( ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/Use_wxWindows.cmake)

          if you are sure you need GL then

       SET(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

          *before* you include this file.

       

       16.Feb.2004: changed INCLUDE to FIND_PACKAGE to read from users own
       non-system CMAKE_MODULE_PATH (Jan Woetzel JW) 07/2006: rewrite as
       FindwxWidgets.cmake, kept for backward compatibilty JW

  UsewxWidgets
       Convenience include for using wxWidgets library

       Finds if wxWidgets is installed and set the appropriate libs, incdirs,
       flags etc.  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES and ADD_DEFINITIONS
       are called.

       USAGE

         SET( wxWidgets_USE_LIBS  gl xml xrc ) # optionally: more than wx std libs
         FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets REQUIRED)
         INCLUDE( ${xWidgets_USE_FILE} )
         ... add your targets here, e.g. ADD_EXECUTABLE/ ADD_LIBRARY ...
         TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIERS( <yourWxDependantTarget>  ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

       

       DEPRECATED

         LINK_LIBRARIES is not called in favor of adding dependencies per target.
