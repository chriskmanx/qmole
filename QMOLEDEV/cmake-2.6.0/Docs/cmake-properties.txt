Properties

  CMake Properties - Properties supported by CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.

This is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake.  Properties
can have different scopes.  They can either be assigned to a source file, a
directory, a target or globally to CMake.  By modifying the values of
properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties of Global Scope

  ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
       Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

       Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
       globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary
       to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE
       generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
       unambiguously.

       Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target
       names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do
       not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this
       property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
       allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different
       directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
       property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and
       refuse to generate the project.

  DISABLED_FEATURES
       List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

       List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.  Be default
       it contains the names of all packages which were not found.  This is
       determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
       searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
       this list.This property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.

  ENABLED_FEATURES
       List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

       List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.  Be default
       it contains the names of all packages which were found.  This is
       determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
       searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
       this list.This property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.

  FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
       Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically search lib64 directories.

       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the
       FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant of
       directories called lib in the search path when building 64-bit
       binaries.

  GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
       Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

       CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
       at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
       causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.

  IN_TRY_COMPILE
       Read-only property that is true during a try-compile configuration.

       True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN command.

  PACKAGES_FOUND
       List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

       List of packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a
       package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

  PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
       List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

       List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
       package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

  REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
       If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

       If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
       report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
       into the filename specified in this property.

  TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
       Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

       On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is
       set to true on such platforms.

  TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
       Does the target platform support shared libraries.

       TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
       platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
       general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
       with no or special OSs.

  __CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_
       Internal property

       Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Directories

  ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
       Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.

       A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the "make clean"
       stage.

  CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
       Should the output of custom commands be left.

       If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for this directory
       will not be removed during the "make clean" stage.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.

       The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of preprocessor
       definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function-style
       definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the
       value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language
       syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may
       be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex.
       "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").  This property will be initialized in
       each directory by its value in the directory's parent.

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
       by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definitions
       with values (but NMake does).

       Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
       certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
       may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
       to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
       adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
       future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
       consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
       report the limitation.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

       This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
       This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in
       the directory's parent.


  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
       Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

       A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded
       from the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
       example typing make will cause the targets to be built.  The same
       concept applies to the default build of other generators.

  LISTFILE_STACK
       The current stack of listfiles being processed.

       This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
       CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
       being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an INCLUDE command
       then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.

  TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
       A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

       If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and
       processed when ctest is run on the directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Targets

  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which archive target files
       should be built.  There are three kinds of target files that may be
       built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated
       as runtime targets.  Static libraries are always treated as archive
       targets.  Module libraries are always treated as library targets.  For
       non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
       For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
       runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an
       archive target.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
       platforms.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

  BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
       Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

       BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the
       target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes
       precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking
       before installation.

  CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT
       Do not delete other variants of this target.

       When a library is built CMake by default generates code to remove any
       existing library using all possible names.  This is needed to support
       libraries that switch between STATIC and SHARED by a user option.
       However when using OUTPUT_NAME to build a static and shared library of
       the same name using different logical target names the two targets
       will remove each other's files.  This can be prevented by setting the
       CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT property to 1.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

       The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of preprocessor
       definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function-style
       definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the
       value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language
       syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may
       be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex.
       "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
       by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definitions
       with values (but NMake does).

       Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
       certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
       may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
       to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
       adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
       future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
       consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
       report the limitation.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.

  COMPILE_FLAGS
       Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.

       The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to
       build sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass
       additional preprocessor definitions.

  DEBUG_POSTFIX
       A postfix that will be applied to this target when build debug.

       A property on a target that specifies a postfix to add to the target
       name when built in debug mode.  For example "foo.dll" versus
       "fooD.dll".  Ignored for Mac Frameworks and App Bundles.

  DEFINE_SYMBOL
       Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.

       DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
       compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
       to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is
       not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
       they are being included from inside their library our outside to
       properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.

  ENABLE_EXPORTS
       Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.

       Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
       final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
       be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
       will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the
       TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms a target-level
       dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
       For non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply ignored since the
       dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is
       loaded.  For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the
       exported symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows-based systems
       including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
       Exclude the target from the all target.

       A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from
       the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
       example typing make will cause this target to be built.  The same
       concept applies to the default build of other generators.  Installing
       a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.

  EchoString
       A message to be displayed when the target is built.

       A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the
       target is built.

  FRAMEWORK
       This target is a framework on the Mac.

       If a shared library target has this property set to true it will be
       built as a framework when built on the mac.  It will have the
       directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
       be used with the -framework option

  Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
       Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.

       If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
       the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
       directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
       not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
       corresponding to the target's source directory.  If the variable
       CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its
       value is used to initialize this property.

  GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
       Generator's file for this target.

       An internal property used by some generators to record the name of
       project or dsp file associated with this target.

  HAS_CXX
       Force a target to use the CXX linker.

       Setting HAS_CXX on a target will force the target to use the C++
       linker (and C++ runtime libraries) for linking even if the target has
       no C++ code in it.

  IMPORTED
       Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

       The boolean value of this property is true for targets created with
       the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library.  It is false for
       targets built within the project.

  IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
       Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

       Lists configuration names available for an IMPORTED target.  The names
       correspond to configurations defined in the project from which the
       target is imported.  If the importing project uses a different set of
       configurations the names may be mapped using the
       MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non-imported
       targets.

  IMPORTED_IMPLIB
       Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

       Specifies the location of the ".lib" part of a windows DLL.  Ignored
       for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

       This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG>
       configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond
       to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
       Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

       Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
       their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
       dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
       link.  This property lists the dependent shared libraries of an
       imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
       interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.
       On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
       time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
       link command line.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

       This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG>
       configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond
       to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

       Lists libraries whose interface is included when an IMPORTED library
       target is linked to another target.  The libraries will be included on
       the link line for the target.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

       This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG>
       configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond
       to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_LOCATION
       Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

       Specifies the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.  For
       executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
       on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside
       Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static
       libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
       For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the
       shared library.  For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
       library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
       is the location of the ".dll" part of the library.  Ignored for
       non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

       This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG>
       configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond
       to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_SONAME
       The "soname" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

       Specifies the "soname" embedded in an imported shared library.  This
       is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
       non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

       This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG>
       configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond
       to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

  IMPORT_PREFIX
       What comes before the import library name.

       Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries
       (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
       target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib")
       on an import library name.

  IMPORT_SUFFIX
       What comes after the import library name.

       Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries
       (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
       target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
       ".lib") on an import library name.

  INSTALL_NAME_DIR
       Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

       INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the
       "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the
       installed targets.

  INSTALL_RPATH
       The rpath to use for installed targets.

       A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
       targets (for platforms that support it).

  INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
       Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

       INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will
       append directories in the linker search path and outside the project
       to the INSTALL_RPATH.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which library target files
       should be built.  There are three kinds of target files that may be
       built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated
       as runtime targets.  Static libraries are always treated as archive
       targets.  Module libraries are always treated as library targets.  For
       non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
       For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
       runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an
       archive target.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
       platforms.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

  LINKER_LANGUAGE
       What tool to use for linking, based on language.

       The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool used to link
       an executable or shared library.  The default is set the language to
       match the files in the library.  CXX and C are common values for this
       property.

  LINK_FLAGS
       Additional flags to use when linking this target.

       The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
       step of a target.  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration
       <CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.

  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration linker flags for a target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.

  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

       By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
       targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
       with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive
       link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
       transitive link dependencies with an explict list.  When the target is
       linked into another target the libraries listed (and recursively their
       link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target also.
       If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will be
       incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
       the default set is non-empty.

  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of
       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

  LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
       End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

       Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to
       determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.
       CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
       directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
       left at -Bdynamic by the end of the library list.  This property
       switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic.

  LOCATION
       Deprecated.  Use LOCATION_<CONFIG> or avoid altogether.

       This property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.
       It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file
       for use in add_custom_command.  In CMake 2.6 and above
       add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its
       COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.
       Therefore this property need not be used.  This property is not
       defined for IMPORTED targets because they were not available in CMake
       2.4 or below anyway.

  LOCATION_<CONFIG>
       Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

       A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is
       located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is
       defined only for library and executable targets.

  MACOSX_BUNDLE
       Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.

       When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac OS
       X will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a GUI
       executable that can be launched from the Finder.

       The bundle Info.plist file is generated automatically.  The following
       target properties may be set to specify its content:
       MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING

         MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT


  MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
       Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target's configuration.

       List configurations of an imported target that may be used for the
       current project's <CONFIG> configuration.  Targets imported from
       another project may not provide the same set of configuration names
       available in the current project.  Setting this property tells CMake
       what imported configurations are suitable for use when building the
       <CONFIG> configuration.  The first configuration in the list found to
       be provided by the imported target is selected.  If no matching
       configurations are available the imported target is considered to be
       not found.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets.

  OUTPUT_NAME
       Sets the real name of a target when it is built.

       Sets the real name of a target when it is built and can be used to
       help create two targets of the same name even though CMake requires
       unique logical target names.  There is also a <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME
       that can set the output name on a per-configuration basis.

  POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
       Deprecated install support.

       The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
       way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
       target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
       used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.

  PREFIX
       What comes before the library name.

       A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
       "lib") on a library name.

  PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
       Deprecated install support.

       The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
       way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
       target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
       used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.

  PRIVATE_HEADER
       Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
       frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
       This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
       PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
       platforms these headers may be installed using the PRIVATE_HEADER
       option to the install(TARGETS) command.

  PUBLIC_HEADER
       Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
       frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
       This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
       Headers directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple platforms
       these headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to the
       install(TARGETS) command.

  RESOURCE
       Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
       frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
       This property may be set to a list of files to be placed in the
       Resources directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
       platforms these files may be installed using the RESOURCE option to
       the install(TARGETS) command.

  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files
       should be built.  There are three kinds of target files that may be
       built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated
       as runtime targets.  Static libraries are always treated as archive
       targets.  Module libraries are always treated as library targets.  For
       non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
       For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
       runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an
       archive target.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
       platforms.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

  SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
       Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

       SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
       generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.

  SOURCES
       Source names specified for a target.

       Read-only list of sources specified for a target.  The names returned
       are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_properties command.

  SOVERSION
       What version number is this target.

       For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the
       build version and api version respectively.  When building or
       installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
       symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
       specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
       shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is
       parsed to extract a "major.minor" version number.  These numbers are
       used as the image version of the binary.

  STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
       Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

       Extra flags to use when linking a static library.

  SUFFIX
       What comes after the library name.

       A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
       ".so") on a library name.

  VERSION
       What version number is this target.

       For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the
       build version and api version respectively.  When building or
       installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
       symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
       specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
       executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version.  When
       building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
       platform supports symlinks.  For shared libraries and executables on
       Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor"
       version number.  These numbers are used as the image version of the
       binary.

  WIN32_EXECUTABLE
       Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

       When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
       Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of of
       just main().This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console
       application.  See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to
       configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.

  XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>
       Set Xcode target attributes directly.

       Tell the Xcode generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given value in
       the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Tests

  FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

       If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
       the test will fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       "[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"

  MEASUREMENT
       Specify a DART measurement and value to be reported for a test.

       If set to a name then that name will be reported to DART as a named
       measurement with a value of 1.  You may also specify a value by
       setting MEASUREMENT to "measurement=value".

  PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.

       If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
       expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
       otherwise the test will fail.

  TIMEOUT
       How many seconds to allow for this test.

       This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
       specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
       process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
       setting takes precedence over DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT and
       CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.

  WILL_FAIL
       If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

       This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
       return a non zero return code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Source Files

  ABSTRACT
       Is this source file an abstract class.

       A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
       represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
       languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
       by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

       The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of preprocessor
       definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function-style
       definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the
       value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language
       syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may
       be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex.
       "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
       by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definitions
       with values (but NMake does).  Xcode does not support
       per-configuration definitions on source files.

       Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
       certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
       may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
       to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
       adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
       future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
       consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
       report the limitation.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

       This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
       Note that Xcode does not support per-configuration source file flags
       so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.

  COMPILE_FLAGS
       Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

       These flags will be added to the list of compile flags when this
       source file builds.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional
       preprocessor definitions.

  EXTERNAL_OBJECT
       If set to true then this is an object file.

       If this property is set to true then the source file is really an
       object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
       the target though.

  GENERATED
       Is this source file generated as part of the build process.

       If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will handle
       it differently in temrs of dependency checking etc.  Otherwise having
       a non-existent source file could create problems.

  HEADER_FILE_ONLY
       Is this source file only a header file.

       A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
       header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
       automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
       determine is certain dependency information should be computed.

  KEEP_EXTENSION
       Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

       If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
       will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
       extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
       example .cxx will go to a .o extension.

  LANGUAGE
       What programming language is the file.

       A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
       source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
       the file extension.  Typical values are CXX C etc.

  LOCATION
       The full path to a source file.

       A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
       the source file.

  MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
       Place a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle or framework.

       Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set are built as
       Mac OS X application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared library
       targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac OS X
       frameworks on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with
       this property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or
       framework content folder specified by the property value.  For bundles
       the content folder is "<name>.app/Contents".  For frameworks the
       content folder is "<name>.framework/Versions/<version>".  See the
       PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for
       specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeadres, or Resources
       directories.

  OBJECT_DEPENDS
       Additional dependencies.

       Additional dependencies that should be checked as part of building
       this source file.

  OBJECT_OUTPUTS
       Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

       Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
       of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
       supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other
       generators.

  SYMBOLIC
       Is this just a name for a rule.

       If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
       that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
       as a symbolic name for a build rule.

  WRAP_EXCLUDE
       Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

       Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
       provide additional functionality.  For example, C++ code can be
       wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc.  If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
       set to true (1 etc) that indicates then this source file should not be
       wrapped.
