ctest version 2.6-patch 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name

  ctest - Testing driver provided by CMake.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

  ctest [options]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description

The "ctest" executable is the CMake test driver program.  CMake-generated
build trees created for projects that use the ENABLE_TESTING and ADD_TEST
commands have testing support.  This program will run the tests and report
results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options

  -C <cfg>, --build-config <cfg>
       Choose configuration to test.

       Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build
       configurations in the same tree.  This option can be used to specify
       which one should be tested.  Example configurations are "Debug" and
       "Release".

  -V,--verbose
       Enable verbose output from tests.

       Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
       displayed.  This option will show all test output.

  -VV,--extra-verbose
       Enable more verbose output from tests.

       Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
       displayed.  This option will show even more test output.

  --debug
       Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.

       This feature will result in large number of output that is mostly
       useful for debugging dashboard problems.

  -Q,--quiet
       Make ctest quiet.

       This option will suppress all the output.  The output log file will
       still be generated if the --output-log is specified.  Options such as
       --verbose, --extra-verbose, and --debug are ignored if --quiet is
       specified.

  -O <file>, --output-log <file>
       Output to log file

       This option tells ctest to write all its output to a log file.

  -N,--show-only
       Disable actual execution of tests.

       This option tells ctest to list the tests that would be run but not
       actually run them.  Useful in conjunction with the -R and -E options.

  -R <regex>, --tests-regex <regex>
       Run tests matching regular expression.

       This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose names match the
       given regular expression.

  -E <regex>, --exclude-regex <regex>
       Exclude tests matching regular expression.

       This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose names match the
       given regular expression.

  -D <dashboard>, --dashboard <dashboard>
       Execute dashboard test

       This option tells ctest to perform act as a Dart client and perform a
       dashboard test.  All tests are <Mode><Test>, where Mode can be
       Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can be Start, Update,
       Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.

  -M <model>, --test-model <model>
       Sets the model for a dashboard

       This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client where the TestModel
       can be Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous.  Combining -M and -T is
       similar to -D

  -T <action>, --test-action <action>
       Sets the dashboard action to perform

       This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client and perform some
       action such as start, build, test etc.  Combining -M and -T is similar
       to -D

  --track <track>
       Specify the track to submit dashboard to

       Submit dashboard to specified track instead of default one.  By
       default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or
       Continuous track, but by specifying this option, the track can be
       arbitrary.

  -S <script>, --script <script>
       Execute a dashboard for a configuration

       This option tells ctest to load in a configuration script which sets a
       number of parameters such as the binary and source directories.  Then
       ctest will do what is required to create and run a dashboard.  This
       option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs ctest -D with the
       appropriate options.

  -SP <script>, --script-new-process <script>
       Execute a dashboard for a configuration

       This option does the same operations as -S but it will do them in a
       seperate process.  This is primarily useful in cases where the script
       may modify the environment and you do not want the modified enviroment
       to impact other -S scripts.

  -A <file>, --add-notes <file>
       Add a notes file with submission

       This option tells ctest to include a notes file when submitting
       dashboard.

  -I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], --tests-information
       Run a specific number of tests by number.

       This option causes ctest to run tests starting at number Start, ending
       at number End, and incrementing by Stride.  Any additional numbers
       after Stride are considered individual test numbers.  Start, End,or
       stride can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given that contains the
       same syntax as the command line.

  -U, --union
       Take the Union of -I and -R

       When both -R and -I are specified by default the intersection of tests
       are run.  By specifying -U the union of tests is run instead.

  --interactive-debug-mode [0|1]
       Set the interactive mode to 0 or 1.

       This option causes ctest to run tests in either an interactive mode or
       a non-interactive mode.  On Windows this means that in non-interactive
       mode, all system debug pop up windows are blocked.  In dashboard mode
       (Experimental, Nightly, Continuous), the default is non-interactive.
       When just running tests not for a dashboard the default is to allow
       popups and interactive debugging.

  --build-and-test
       Configure, build and run a test.

       This option tells ctest to configure (i.e.  run cmake on), build, and
       or execute a test.  The configure and test steps are optional.  The
       arguments to this command line are the source and binary directories.
       By default this will run CMake on the Source/Bin directories specified
       unless --build-nocmake is specified.  Both --build-makeprogram and
       --build-generator MUST be provided to use --built-and-test.  If
       --test-command is specified then that will be run after the build is
       complete.  Other options that affect this mode are --build-target
       --build-nocmake, --build-run-dir, --build-two-config, --build-exe-dir,
       --build-project,--build-noclean, --build-options

  --build-target
       Specify a specific target to build.

       This option goes with the --build-and-test option, if left out the all
       target is built.

  --build-nocmake
       Run the build without running cmake first.

       Skip the cmake step.

  --build-run-dir
       Specify directory to run programs from.

       Directory where programs will be after it has been compiled.

  --build-two-config
       Run CMake twice

  --build-exe-dir
       Specify the directory for the executable.

  --build-generator
       Specify the generator to use.

  --build-project
       Specify the name of the project to build.

  --build-makeprogram
       Specify the make program to use.

  --build-noclean
       Skip the make clean step.

  --build-config-sample
       A sample executable to use to determine the configuraiton

       A sample executable to use to determine the configuraiton that should
       be used.  e.g.  Debug/Release/etc

  --build-options
       Add extra options to the build step.

       This option must be the last option with the exception of
       --test-command

  --test-command
       The test to run with the --build-and-test option.

  --test-timeout
       The time limit in seconds, internal use only.

  --tomorrow-tag
       Nightly or experimental starts with next day tag.

       This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.

  --ctest-config
       The configuration file used to initialize CTest state when submitting
       dashboards.

       This option tells CTest to use different initialization file instead
       of CTestConfiguration.tcl.  This way multiple initialization files can
       be used for example to submit to multiple dashboards.

  --overwrite
       Overwrite CTest configuration option.

       By default ctest uses configuration options from configuration file.
       This option will overwrite the configuration option.

  --extra-submit <file>[;<file>]
       Submit extra files to the dashboard.

       This option will submit extra files to the dashboard.

  --force-new-ctest-process
       Run child CTest instances as new processes

       By default CTest will run child CTest instances within the same
       process.  If this behavior is not desired, this argument will enforce
       new processes for child CTest processes.

  --submit-index
       Submit individual dashboard tests with specific index

       This option allows performing the same CTest action (such as test)
       multiple times and submit all stages to the same dashboard (Dart2
       required).  Each execution requires different index.

Generators

The following generators are available on this platform:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands

  break
       Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.

         break()

       Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop

  build_name
       Deprecated.  Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.

         build_name(variable)

       Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and
       compiler settings.  These values are now available through the
       CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.

  cmake_minimum_required
       Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.

         cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]]
                                [FATAL_ERROR])

       If the current version of CMake is lower than that required it will
       stop processing the project and report an error.  When a version
       higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes

         cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]])

       which sets the cmake policy version level to the version specified.
       When version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly invokes

         cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)

       which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.

       The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored.  It is left from CMake
       versions 2.4 and lower in which failure to meet the minimum version
       was a warning by default.

  cmake_policy
       Manage CMake Policy settings.

       As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior
       in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.
       The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
       building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each
       new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form
       "CMP<NNNN>" where "<NNNN>" is an integer index.  Documentation
       associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the
       reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to
       select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior
       to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no
       setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is
       produced requesting that the policy be set.

       The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW
       behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we
       encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.

         cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch])

       Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given
       version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or
       earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced
       after the specified version will be reset to use OLD behavior with a
       warning.  This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given
       CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new
       policies.  The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the
       command will report an error.  In order to get compatibility features
       supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy
       CMP0001.

         cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> NEW)
         cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> OLD)

       Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.
       Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a
       policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one
       may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy
       state to NEW.

         cmake_policy(PUSH)
         cmake_policy(POP)

       Push and pop the current policy setting state on a stack.  Each PUSH
       must have a matching POP.  This is useful when mixing multiple
       projects, subprojects, and files included from external projects that
       may each have been written for a different version of CMake.  Each
       subdirectory entered by the project automatically pushes a new level
       on the stack to isolate the subdirectories from their parents.

  configure_file
       Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

         configure_file(InputFile OutputFile
                        [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY])

       The Input and Output files have to have full paths.  This command
       replaces any variables in the input file referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@
       with their values as determined by CMake.  If a variable is not
       defined, it will be replaced with nothing.  If COPYONLY is specified,
       then no variable expansion will take place.  If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
       specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style escaped.  The
       file will be configured with the current values of CMake variables.
       If @ONLY is specified, only variables of the form @VAR@ will be
       replaces and ${VAR} will be ignored.  This is useful for configuring
       scripts that use ${VAR}.  Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be
       replaced with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the
       setting of VAR in CMake

  CTEST_BUILD

  CTEST_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY
       empties the binary directory

         CTEST_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY( directory )

       Removes a binary directory.  This command will perform some checks
       prior to deleting the directory in an attempt to avoid malicious or
       accidental directory deletion.

  CTEST_MEMCHECK
       Tests the repository.

         CTEST_MEMCHECK([BUILD build_dir] [RETURN_VALUE res])

       Performs a memory checking of tests in the given build directory and

                     script_file_name2 ...)

       Runs a script or scripts much like if it was run from ctest -S.  If no
       argument is provided then the current script is run using the current
       settings of the variables.  If NEW_PROCESS is specified then each
       script will be run in a seperate process.

  CTEST_SLEEP
       sleeps for some amount of time

         CTEST_SLEEP( seconds )
         CTEST_SLEEP( time1 duration time2 )

       With one argument it will sleep for a given number of seconds.  With
       three arguments it will wait for time2 - time1 - duration seconds.

  CTEST_START
       Starts the testing for a given model

         CTEST_START(Model [TRACK <track>] [source [binary]])

       Starts the testing for a given model.  The command should be called
       after the binary directory is initialized.  If the 'source' and
       'binary' directory are not specified, it reads the
       CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY and CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY.  If the track is
       specified, the submissions will go to the specified track.

  CTEST_SUBMIT
       Submits the repository.

       Updates the given source directory and stores results in Update.xml.
       The second argument is a variable that will hold the number of files
       modified.  If there is a problem, the variable will be -1.

  else
       Starts the else portion of an if block.

         else(expression)

       See the if command.

  elseif
       Starts the elseif portion of an if block.

         elseif(expression)

       See the if command.

  endforeach
       Ends a list of commands in a FOREACH block.

         endforeach(expression)

       See the FOREACH command.

  endfunction
       Ends a list of commands in a function block.

         endfunction(expression)

       See the function command.

  endif
       Ends a list of commands in an if block.

         endif(expression)

       See the if command.

  endmacro
       Ends a list of commands in a macro block.

         endmacro(expression)

       See the macro command.

  endwhile
       Ends a list of commands in a while block.

         endwhile(expression)

       See the while command.

  exec_program
       Deprecated.  Use the execute_process() command instead.

       Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt
       file.

         exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
                      [ARGS <arguments to executable>]
                      [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
                      [RETURN_VALUE <var>])

       The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The
       executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is
       better to use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to the
       program.  This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in
       the executable path.  An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies a
       variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return value of
       the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is
       specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console
       running cmake.


  execute_process
       Execute one or more child processes.

         execute_process(COMMAND <cmd1> [args1...]]
                         [COMMAND <cmd2> [args2...] [...]]
                         [WORKING_DIRECTORY <directory>]
                         [TIMEOUT <seconds>]
                         [RESULT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                         [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                         [ERROR_VARIABLE <variable>]
                         [INPUT_FILE <file>]
                         [OUTPUT_FILE <file>]
                         [ERROR_FILE <file>]
                         [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                         [ERROR_QUIET]
                         [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                         [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])

       Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard
       output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A
       single standard error pipe is used for all processes.  If
       WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the
       current working directory of the child processes.  If TIMEOUT is given
       the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
       specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If
       RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain the
       result of running the processes.  This will be an integer return code
       from the last child or a string describing an error condition.  If
       OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable named will be
       set with the contents of the standard output and standard error pipes
       respectively.  If the same variable is named for both pipes their
       output will be merged in the order produced.  If INPUT_FILE,
       OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be attached to
       the standard input of the first process, standard output of the last
       process, or standard error of all processes respectively.  If
       OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then the standard output or
       standard error results will be quietly ignored.  If more than one
       OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence
       is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the
       output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake
       process itself.

       The execute_process command is a newer more powerful version of
       exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.

  file
       File manipulation command.

         file(WRITE filename "message to write"... )
         file(APPEND filename "message to write"... )
         file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset] [HEX])
         file(STRINGS filename variable [LIMIT_COUNT num]
              [LIMIT_INPUT numBytes] [LIMIT_OUTPUT numBytes]
              [LENGTH_MINIMUM numBytes] [LENGTH_MAXIMUM numBytes]
              [NEWLINE_CONSUME] [REGEX regex]
              [NO_HEX_CONVERSION])
         file(GLOB variable [RELATIVE path] [globbing expressions]...)
         file(GLOB_RECURSE variable [RELATIVE path] 
              [globbing expressions]...)
         file(REMOVE [file1 ...])
         file(REMOVE_RECURSE [file1 ...])
         file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [directory1 directory2 ...])
         file(RELATIVE_PATH variable directory file)
         file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result)
         file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path result)
         file(DOWNLOAD url file [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS status] [LOG log])

       WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'.  It
       overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it
       does not exist.

       APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will
       append it to the end of the file

       READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable.
       It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes.  If the
       argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to
       hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.

       STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in
       a variable.  Binary data in the file are ignored.  Carriage return
       (CR) characters are ignored.  It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola
       S-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format
       when reading them.  Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.

       LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return.  LIMIT_INPUT
       sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file.
       LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output
       variable.  LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to
       return.  Shorter strings are ignored.  LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum
       length of a string to return.  Longer strings are split into strings
       no longer than the maximum length.  NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to
       be included in strings instead of terminating them.

       REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be
       returned.  Typical usage

         file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

       stores a list in the variable "myfile" in which each item is a line
       from the input file.

       GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing
       expressions and store it into the variable.  Globbing expressions are
       similar to regular expressions, but much simpler.  If RELATIVE flag is
       specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a
       relative path to the given path.

       Examples of globbing expressions include:

          *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
          *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
          f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

       GLOB_RECURSE will generate similar list as the regular GLOB, except it
       will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and
       match the files.

       Examples of recursive globbing include:

          /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

       MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also if their parent
       directories don't exist yet

       REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories

       REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also
       non-empty directories

       RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given
       file.

       TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.
       The input can be a single path or a system path like "$ENV{PATH}".
       Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes
       one argument.

       TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from a
       cmake style path into the native path style \ for windows and / for
       UNIX.

       DOWNLOAD will download the givin URL to the given file.  If LOG var is
       specified a log of the download will be put in var.  If STATUS var is
       specified the status of the operation will be put in var.  The status
       is returned in a list of length 2.  The first element is the numeric
       return value for the operation, and the second element is a string
       value for the error.  A 0 numeric error means no error in the
       operation.  If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout
       after time seconds, time can be specified as a float.


  find_file
       Find the full path to a file.

          find_path(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_path(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_path(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a full path to named file.  A cache entry
       named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command.  If the
       full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and
       the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If
       nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search
       will be attempted again the next time find_path is invoked with the
       same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is searched
       for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
       Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.
       If ENV var is found in the PATHS section the environment variable var
       will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a
       cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to
       list the system path variable.  The argument after DOC will be used
       for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES can be used
       to give sub directories that will be appended to the search paths.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search cmake specific environment variables.  This can be skipped
       if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       2.  Search cmake variables with the same names as the cmake specific
       environment variables.  These are intended to be used on the command
       line with a -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       3.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          INCLUDE

       4.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       5.  Search the paths specified after PATHS or in the short-hand
       version of the command.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The reason the paths listed in the call to the command are searched
       last is that most users of CMake would expect things to be found first
       in the locations specified by their environment.  Projects may
       override this behavior by simply calling the command twice:

          find_path(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_path(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of these calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that neither call will search again.

  find_library
       Find a library.

          find_library(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_library(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_library(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a library.  A cache entry named by <VAR>
       is created to store the result of this command.  If the library is
       found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be
       repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the
       result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
       the next time find_library is invoked with the same variable.  The
       name of the library that is searched for is specified by the names
       listed after the NAMES argument.  Additional search locations can be
       specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the PATHS
       section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a
       system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For
       example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable.  The
       argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the
       cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES can be used to give sub directories that will be
       appended to the search paths.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search cmake specific environment variables.  This can be skipped
       if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       2.  Search cmake variables with the same names as the cmake specific
       environment variables.  These are intended to be used on the command
       line with a -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       3.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          LIB

       4.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       5.  Search the paths specified after PATHS or in the short-hand
       version of the command.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The reason the paths listed in the call to the command are searched
       last is that most users of CMake would expect things to be found first
       in the locations specified by their environment.  Projects may
       override this behavior by simply calling the command twice:

          find_library(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_library(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of these calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that neither call will search again.

       If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set to the full
       path to the framework <fullPath>/A.framework.  When a full path to a
       framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework A, and a
       -F<fullPath> to link the framework to the target.

  find_package
       Load settings for an external project.

         find_package(<package> [major[.minor[.patch]]] [EXACT] [QUIET]
                      [[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]])

       Finds and loads settings from an external project.  <package>_FOUND
       will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the
       package is found package-specific information is provided through
       variables documented by the package itself.  The QUIET option disables
       messages if the package cannot be found.  The REQUIRED option stops
       processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.  A
       package-specific list of components may be listed after the REQUIRED
       option or after the COMPONENTS option if no REQUIRED option is given.
       The "[major[.minor[.patch]]]" version argument specifies a desired
       version with which the package found should be compatible.  The EXACT
       option requests that the version be matched exactly.  Version support
       is currently provided only on a package-by-package basis (details
       below).

       User code should generally look for packages using the above simple
       signature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the
       full command signature and details of the search process.  Project
       maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command
       are encouraged to read on.

       The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module"
       mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is
       invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file
       called "Find<package>.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the
       CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by
       CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package, checking the
       version, and producing any needed messages.  Many find-modules provide
       limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation.
       If no module is found the command proceeds to Config mode.

       The complete Config mode command signature is:

         find_package(<package> [major[.minor[.patch]]] [EXACT] [QUIET]
                      [[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]] [NO_MODULE]
                      [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
                      [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
                      [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                      [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                      [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                      [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                      [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                       ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

       The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly.  It
       is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced
       signature.

       Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the
       package to be found.  A cache entry called <package>_DIR is created to
       hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command
       searches for a package with the name <package>.  If the NAMES option
       is given the names following it are used instead of <package>.  The
       command searches for a file called "<name>Config.cmake" or
       "<lower-case-name>-config.cmake" for each name specified.  A
       replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given
       using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is specified below.
       Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.
       Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the
       location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file
       is stored in the cmake variable <package>_CONFIG.

       If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate
       an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is
       specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a
       fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If
       <package>_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a
       configuration file a fatal error is always generated because user
       intervention is required.

       When the "[major[.minor[.patch]]]" version argument is specified
       Config mode will only find a version of the package that claims
       compatibility with the requested version.  If the EXACT option is
       given only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
       requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any
       convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version
       numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages
       themselves.  For a candidate package confguration file
       "<config-file>.cmake" the corresponding version file is located next
       to it and named either "<config-file>-version.cmake" or
       "<config-file>Version.cmake".  If no such version file is available
       then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any
       requested version.  When a version file is found it is loaded to check
       the requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested
       scope in which the following variables have been defined:

         PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the <package> name
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = requested major version, if any
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = requested minor version, if any
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = requested patch version, if any

       The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and
       sets these variables:

         PACKAGE_VERSION            = package version (major[.minor[.patch]])
         PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
         PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible

       These variables are checked by the find_package command to determine
       whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They
       are not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version
       is acceptable the following variables are set:

         <package>_VERSION       = package version (major[.minor[.patch]])
         <package>_VERSION_MAJOR = major from major[.minor[.patch]], if any
         <package>_VERSION_MINOR = minor from major[.minor[.patch]], if any
         <package>_VERSION_PATCH = patch from major[.minor[.patch]], if any

       and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When
       multiple package configuration files are available whose version files
       claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which
       one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest
       version number.

       Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.
       Much of the interface is provided for completeness and for use
       internally by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code
       should simply call

         find_package(<package> [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])

       in order to find a package.  Package maintainers providing CMake
       package configuration files are encouraged to name and install them
       such that the procedure outlined below will find them without
       requiring use of additional options.

       CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the
       package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
       configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.
       Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (W), UNIX
       (U), or Apple (A) conventions.

         <prefix>/                                               (W)
         <prefix>/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
         <prefix>/(share|lib)/<name>*/                           (U)
         <prefix>/(share|lib)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/             (U)

       On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the
       following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles
       containing a configuration file:

         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/                    (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

       In all cases the <name> is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds
       to any of the names specified (<package> or names given by NAMES).  If
       PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each (W) or
       (U) directory entry one-by-one.

       This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with
       projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.
       Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on
       Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's
       installation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for
       installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple
       packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories
       are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are
       intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The cmake variables
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of
       preference as specified below.

       The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following
       steps.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified steps 1-5 are skipped.

       1.  Search cmake specific environment variables.  This can be skipped
       if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       2.  Search cmake variables with the same names as the cmake specific
       environment variables.  These are intended to be used on the command
       line with a -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
       passed.

          CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       3.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.  Path entries ending
       in "/bin" or "/sbin" are automatically converted to their parent
       directories.

          PATH

       4.  Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake GUI.
       This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is passed.  It is intended
       for the case when a user is building multiple dependent projects one
       after another.

       5.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       6.  Search paths specified by the PATHS option.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The reason the paths listed in the call to the command are searched
       last is that most users of CMake would expect things to be found first
       in the locations specified by their environment.  Projects may
       override this behavior by simply calling the command twice:

          find_package(<package> PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_package(<package>)

       Once one of these calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that neither call will search again.

  find_path
       Find the directory containing a file.

          find_path(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_path(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_path(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a directory containing the named file.  A
       cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this
       command.  If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in
       the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable
       is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND,
       and the search will be attempted again the next time find_path is
       invoked with the same variable.  The name of the file in a directory
       that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES
       argument.  Additional search locations can be specified after the
       PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the PATHS section the
       environment variable var will be read and converted from a system
       environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV
       PATH would be a way to list the system path variable.  The argument
       after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.
       PATH_SUFFIXES can be used to give sub directories that will be
       appended to the search paths.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search cmake specific environment variables.  This can be skipped
       if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       2.  Search cmake variables with the same names as the cmake specific
       environment variables.  These are intended to be used on the command
       line with a -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       3.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          INCLUDE

       4.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       5.  Search the paths specified after PATHS or in the short-hand
       version of the command.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The reason the paths listed in the call to the command are searched
       last is that most users of CMake would expect things to be found first
       in the locations specified by their environment.  Projects may
       override this behavior by simply calling the command twice:

          find_path(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_path(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of these calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that neither call will search again.

       When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as A/b.h, then
       the framework search will look for A.framework/Headers/b.h.  If that
       is found the path will be set to the path to the framework.  CMake
       will convert this to the correct -F option to include the file.

  find_program
       Find an executable program.

          find_program(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_program(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_program(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a program.  A cache entry named by <VAR>
       is created to store the result of this command.  If the program is
       found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be
       repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the
       result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
       the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.  The
       name of the program that is searched for is specified by the names
       listed after the NAMES argument.  Additional search locations can be
       specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the PATHS
       section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a
       system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For
       example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable.  The
       argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the
       cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES can be used to give sub directories that will be
       appended to the search paths.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search cmake specific environment variables.  This can be skipped
       if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       2.  Search cmake variables with the same names as the cmake specific
       environment variables.  These are intended to be used on the command
       line with a -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       3.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          

       4.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       5.  Search the paths specified after PATHS or in the short-hand
       version of the command.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER". - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The reason the paths listed in the call to the command are searched
       last is that most users of CMake would expect things to be found first
       in the locations specified by their environment.  Projects may
       override this behavior by simply calling the command twice:

          find_program(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_program(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of these calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that neither call will search again.

  foreach
       Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

         foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endforeach(loop_var)
         foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
         foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])

       All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach are recorded
       without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated, the recorded
       list of commands is invoked once for each argument listed in the
       original foreach command.  Before each iteration of the loop
       "${loop_var}" will be set as a variable with the current value in the
       list.

       Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of numbers.  There are
       three types of this iteration:

       * When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to
       "total".

       * When specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from the
       first number to the second number.

       * The third optional number is the increment used to iterate from the
       first number to the second number.

  function
       Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

         function(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endfunction(<name>)

       Define a function named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2
       arg3 (...).  Commands listed after function, but before the matching
       endfunction, are not invoked until the function is invoked.  When it
       is invoked, the commands recorded in the function are first modified
       by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed,
       and then invoked as normal commands.  In addition to referencing the
       formal parameters you can reference the variable ARGC which will be
       set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as
       ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...  which will have the actual values of the
       arguments passed in.  This facilitates creating functions with
       optional arguments.  Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
       given to the function and ARGN holds the list of argument pass the
       last expected argument.

  get_cmake_property
       Get a property of the CMake instance.

         get_cmake_property(VAR property)

       Get a property from the CMake instance.  The value of the property is
       stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, CMake will
       report an error.  Some supported properties include: VARIABLES,
       CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, and MACROS.

  get_directory_property
       Get a property of the directory.

         get_directory_property(VAR [DIRECTORY dir] property)

       Get a property from the Directory.  The value of the property is
       stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, CMake will
       report an error.  The properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES,
       COMMANDS, MACROS, INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, DEFINITIONS,
       INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, LISTFILE_STACK, PARENT_DIRECTORY, and
       DEFINITION varname.  If the DIRECTORY argument is provided then the
       property of the provided directory will be retrieved instead of the
       current directory.  You can only get properties of a directory during
       or after it has been traversed by cmake.

  get_filename_component
       Get a specific component of a full filename.

         get_filename_component(VarName FileName
                                PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE
                                [CACHE])

       Set VarName to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME), file extension
       (EXT), file name without extension (NAME_WE) of FileName, or the full
       absolute (ABSOLUTE) file name without symlinks.  Note that the path is
       converted to Unix slashes format and has no trailing slashes.  The
       longest file extension is always considered.  If the optional CACHE
       argument is specified, the result variable is added to the cache.

         get_filename_component(VarName FileName
                                PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS ArgVar]
                                [CACHE])

       The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or
       left as a full path.  If PROGRAM_ARGS is present with PROGRAM, then
       any command-line arguments present in the FileName string are split
       from the program name and stored in ArgVar.  This is used to separate
       a program name from its arguments in a command line string.

  get_property
       Get a property.

         get_property(<variable>
                      <GLOBAL             |
                       DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                       TARGET    <target> |
                       SOURCE    <source> |
                       TEST      <test>   |
                       VARIABLE>
                      PROPERTY <name>
                      [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

       Get one property from one object in a scope.  The first argument
       specifies the variable in which to store the result.  The second
       argument determines the scope from which to get the property.  It must
       be one of the following:

       GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another
       directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or
       relative path.

       TARGET scope must name one existing target.

       SOURCE scope must name one source file.

       TEST scope must name one existing test.

       VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of
       the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value is
       returned.  If the SET option is given the variable is set to a boolean
       value indicating whether the property has been set.If the DEFINED
       option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating
       whether the property has been defined such as with define_property.
       If BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to a
       string containing documentation for the requested property.  If
       documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined
       NOTFOUND is returned.

  if
       Conditionally execute a group of commands.

         if(expression)
           # then section.
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         elseif(expression2)
           # elseif section.
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         else(expression)
           # else section.
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endif(expression)

       Evaluates the given expression.  If the result is true, the commands
       in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in the else
       section are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are optional.  You
       may have multiple elseif clauses.  Note that the same expression must
       be given to if, and endif.  Long expressions can be used and the order
       or precedence is that the EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED operators will
       be evaluated first.  Then any EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS,
       STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be evaluated.  Then NOT operators
       and finally AND, OR operators will be evaluated.  Possible expressions
       are:

         if(variable)

       True if the variable's value is not empty, 0, N, NO, OFF, FALSE,
       NOTFOUND, or <variable>-NOTFOUND.

         if(NOT variable)

       True if the variable's value is empty, 0, N, NO, OFF, FALSE, NOTFOUND,
       or <variable>-NOTFOUND.

         if(variable1 AND variable2)

       True if both variables would be considered true individually.

         if(variable1 OR variable2)

       True if either variable would be considered true individually.

         if(COMMAND command-name)

       True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
       invoked.

         if(POLICY policy-id)

       True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form CMP<NNNN>).

         if(EXISTS file-name)
         if(EXISTS directory-name)

       True if the named file or directory exists.  Behavior is well-defined
       only for full paths.

         if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)

       True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two files doesn't
       exist.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.

         if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)

       True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined only
       for full paths.

         if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)

       True if the given path is an absolute path.

          if(variable MATCHES regex)
         if(string MATCHES regex)

       True if the given string or variable's value matches the given regular
       expression.

         if(variable LESS number)
         if(string LESS number)
         if(variable GREATER number)
         if(string GREATER number)
         if(variable EQUAL number)
         if(string EQUAL number)

       True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and the
       inequality or equality is true.

         if(variable STRLESS string)
         if(string STRLESS string)
         if(variable STRGREATER string)
         if(string STRGREATER string)
         if(variable STREQUAL string)
         if(string STREQUAL string)

       True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less
       (or greater, or equal) than the string on the right.

         if(DEFINED variable)

       True if the given variable is defined.  It does not matter if the
       variable is true or false just if it has been set.

  include
       Read CMake listfile code from the given file.

         include(file1 [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>])
         include(module [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>])

       Reads CMake listfile code from the given file.  Commands in the file
       are processed immediately as if they were written in place of the
       include command.  If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if
       the file does not exist.  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable
       will be set to the full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND
       if it failed.

       If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name
       <modulename>.cmake is searched in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.

  list
       List operations.

         list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)
         list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...] <output variable>)
         list(APPEND <list> <element> [<element> ...])
         list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)
         list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])
         list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])
         list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])
         list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)
         list(REVERSE <list>)
         list(SORT <list>)

       LENGTH will return a given list's length.

       GET will return list of elements specified by indices from the list.

       APPEND will append elements to the list.

       FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or -1
       if it wasn't found.

       INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.

       REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the list.  The
       difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items, while
       REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.

       REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.

       REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.

       SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.

       NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings.  To create a
       list the set command can be used.  For example, set(var a b c d e)
       creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var "a b c d e") creates a
       string or a list with one item in it.

       When specifying index values, if <element index> is 0 or greater, it
       is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the
       first list element.  If <element index> is -1 or lesser, it is indexed
       from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element.
       Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from
       0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.


  macro
       Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.

         macro(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endmacro(<name>)

       Define a macro named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3
       (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro,
       are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the
       commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal
       parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as
       normal commands.  In addition to referencing the formal parameters you
       can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of
       arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1}
       ${ARGV2} ...  which will have the actual values of the arguments
       passed in.  This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments.
       Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the
       macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument pass the last expected
       argument.  Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN
       are not variables in the usual CMake sense.  They are string
       replacements much like the c preprocessor would do with a macro.  If
       you want true CMake variables you should look at the function command.

  make_directory
       Deprecated.  Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.

         make_directory(directory)

       Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any
       parent directories that do not exist will also be created.  Use with
       care.

  mark_as_advanced
       Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

         mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)

       Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable
       will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show
       advanced option is on.  If CLEAR is the first argument advanced
       variables are changed back to unadvanced.  If FORCE is the first
       argument, then the variable is made advanced.  If neither FORCE nor
       CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if the
       variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
       changed.

       It does nothing in script mode.

  math
       Mathematical expressions.

         math(EXPR <output variable> <math expression>)

       EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return result in the output
       variable.  Example mathematical expression is '5 * ( 10 + 13 )'.
       Supported operators are + - * / % | & ^ ~ << >> * / %.  They have the
       same meaning as they do in c code.

  message
       Display a message to the user.

         message([SEND_ERROR | STATUS | FATAL_ERROR]
                 "message to display" ...)

       By default the message is displayed in a pop up window (CMakeSetup),
       or in the stdout of cmake, or the error section of ccmake.  If the
       first argument is SEND_ERROR then an error is raised, and the generate
       phase will be skipped.  If the first argument is FATAL_ERROR, all
       processing is halted.  If the first argument is STATUS then the
       message is displayed in the progress line for the GUI, or with a -- in
       the command line cmake.

  option
       Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

         option(<option_variable> "help string describing option"
                [initial value])

       Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.  If no initial
       value is provided, OFF is used.

  remove
       Deprecated.  Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.

         remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

       Removes VALUE from the variable VAR.  This is typically used to remove
       entries from a vector (e.g.  semicolon separated list).  VALUE is
       expanded.

  return
       Return from a directory or function.

         return()

       Returns from a directory or function.  When this command is
       encountered, it caused process of the current function or directory to
       stop and control is return to the caller of the function, or the
       parent directory if any.  Note that a macro is not a function and does
       not handle return like a function does.

  separate_arguments
       Split space separated arguments into a semi-colon separated list.

         separate_arguments(VARIABLE)

       Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated list.  All
       spaces are replaced with ';'.  This helps with generating command
       lines.

  set
       Set a CMAKE variable to a given value.

         set(<variable> <value> [[CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])

       Within CMake sets <variable> to the value <value>.  <value> is
       expanded before <variable> is set to it.  If CACHE is present, then
       the <variable> is put in the cache.  <type> and <docstring> are then
       required.  <type> is used by the CMake GUI to choose a widget with
       which the user sets a value.  The value for <type> may be one of

         FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.
         PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.
         STRING   = Arbitrary string.
         BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.
         INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).

       If <type> is INTERNAL, then the <value> is always written into the
       cache, replacing any values existing in the cache.  If it is not a
       cache variable, then this always writes into the current makefile.
       The FORCE option will overwrite the cache value removing any changes
       by the user.

       If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope
       above the current scope.  Each new directory or function creates a new
       scope.  This command will set the value of a variable into the parent
       directory or calling function (whichever is applicable to the case at
       hand) If VALUE is not specified then the variable is removed from the
       parent scope.

         set(<variable> <value1> ... <valueN>)

       In this case <variable> is set to a semicolon separated list of
       values.

       <variable> can be an environment variable such as:

         set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )

       in which case the environment variable will be set.

  set_directory_properties
       Set a property of the directory.

         set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

       Set a property for the current directory and subdirectories.  If the
       property is not found, CMake will report an error.  The properties
       include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
       INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.

       ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as
       a part of "make clean" stage.

  set_property
       Set a named property in a given scope.

         set_property(<GLOBAL                            |
                       DIRECTORY [dir]                   |
                       TARGET    [target1 [target2 ...]] |
                       SOURCE    [src1 [src2 ...]]       |
                       TEST      [test1 [test2 ...]]>
                      [APPEND]
                      PROPERTY <name> [value1 [value2 ...]])

       Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope.  The first
       argument determines the scope in which the property is set.  It must
       be one of the following:

       GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another
       directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or
       relative path.

       TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.

       SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.

       TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.

       The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of
       the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used to compose the
       property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.  If the
       APPEND option is given the list is appended to any existing property
       value.

  site_name
       Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

         site_name(variable)


  string
       String operations.

         string(REGEX MATCH <regular_expression>
                <output variable> <input> [<input>...])
         string(REGEX MATCHALL <regular_expression>
                <output variable> <input> [<input>...])
         string(REGEX REPLACE <regular_expression>
                <replace_expression> <output variable>
                <input> [<input>...])
         string(REPLACE <match_string>
                <replace_string> <output variable>
                <input> [<input>...])
         string(COMPARE EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(COMPARE LESS <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(COMPARE GREATER <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(ASCII <number> [<number> ...] <output variable>)
         string(CONFIGURE <string1> <output variable>
                [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])
         string(TOUPPER <string1> <output variable>)
         string(TOLOWER <string1> <output variable>)
         string(LENGTH <string> <output variable>)
         string(SUBSTRING <string> <begin> <length> <output variable>)
         string(STRIP <string> <output variable>)
         string(RANDOM [LENGTH <length>] [ALPHABET <alphabet>]
                <output variable>)

       REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and store the match
       in the output variable.

       REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times as
       possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.

       REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many times as
       possible and substitute the replacement expression for the match in
       the output.  The replace expression may refer to paren-delimited
       subexpressions of the match using \1, \2, ..., \9.  Note that two
       backslashes (\\1) are required in CMake code to get a backslash
       through argument parsing.

       REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in the input with
       replace_string and store the result in the output.

       COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the strings and store
       true or false in the output variable.

       ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII characters.

       CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE transforms a
       file.

       TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower characters.

       LENGTH will return a given string's length.

       SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.

       STRIP will return a substring of a given string with leading and
       trailing spaces removed.

       RANDOM will return a random string of given length consisting of
       characters from the given alphabet.  Default length is 5 characters
       and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case letters.

       The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:

          ^         Matches at beginning of a line
          $         Matches at end of a line
          .         Matches any single character
          [ ]       Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
          [^ ]      Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
           -        Matches any character in range on either side of a dash
          *         Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
          +         Matches preceding pattern one or more times
          ?         Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
          |         Matches a pattern on either side of the |
          ()        Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved in the special CMake variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).

  variable_watch
       Watch the CMake variable for change.

         variable_watch(<variable name> [<command to execute>])

       If the specified variable changes, the message will be printed about
       the variable being changed.  If the command is specified, the command
       will be executed.  The command will receive the following arguments:
       COMMAND(<variable> <access> <value> <current list file> <stack>)

  while
       Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

         while(condition)
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endwhile(condition)

       All commands between while and the matching endwhile are recorded
       without being invoked.  Once the endwhile is evaluated, the recorded
       list of commands is invoked as long as the condition is true.  The
       condition is evaluated using the same logic as the if command.

  write_file
       Deprecated.  Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.

         write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])

       The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
       messages to write.  If the argument APPEND is specified, then the
       message will be appended.

       NOTE 1: file(WRITE ...  and file(APPEND ...  do exactly the same as
       this one but add some more functionality.

       NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used as an
       input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead
       to an infinite loop.  Use configure_file if you want to generate input
       files to CMake.

Properties

  CMake Properties - Properties supported by CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.

This is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake.  Properties
can have different scopes.  They can either be assigned to a source file, a
directory, a target or globally to CMake.  By modifying the values of
properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility Commands

  CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.

This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previous
CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility reasons.  You
should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands.  ;-)
