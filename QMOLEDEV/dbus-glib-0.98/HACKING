The mainline git tree for this code is at
git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib.

= Creating changes =

Be sure to match the existing code style (Emacs: "gnu").

If you are making major changes which you wish to be incorporated upstream,
please do as small commits to your local git tree, so there is a good
history of your changes.

When you consider changes ready for merging to mainline, use 
"git-format-patch" or otherwise generate diffs.  Post those diffs
to a new bug at http://bugs.freedesktop.org, project DBus, component GLib.

For nontrivial changes *please* try to extend the test suite to cover it.  The
test infrastructure is in test/core/, and currently there are a lot of tests
in the single file test/core/test-dbus-glib.c.  Extending this file is
suggested (in the future we would like to break this file up).

Run "make check" to run the test suite.

= Committing =

If applying a patch from someone else that created them via 
"git-format-patch", you can use "git-am -s" to apply.  Otherwise
apply the patch and then use "git commit --author ..."

Regardless:

== Nontrivial changes ==
Nontrivial patches should always go through Bugzilla for peer review, so
you should have a bug number.  The commit should be of the form:

Bug XXXXXX: Single line summary here

	* dbus/filename.c: Why I changed this.
	* dbus/otherfile.c: Why I changed this.

== Trivial changes ==

Just use a single line summary, like:

Fix typo in NEWS

= Making a release =

DBus-Glib now uses an even-stable odd-development release numbering
system.  The current number in configure.ac should be odd.

To make a release (please replace use of 0.76 with the new version)

* make
* make distcheck
* edit configure.ac, change version to even (e.g. 0.75 -> 0.76)
* also in configure.ac, update LT_CURRENT, LT_REVISION and LT_AGE
* ./autogen.sh
* make
* make distcheck
* sign the tarball (or use: make dbus-glib-0.76.tar.gz.asc)
* make maintainer-upload-release
* git commit -m "Release"
* git tag -a dbus-glib_0.76
* edit configure.ac, change version to odd (e.g. 0.76 -> 0.77)
* git commit -m "Bump version for development"
* Update the wiki: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
* Announce the release on the mailing list, summarizing notable changes.

NEWS is unmaintained.
