<p>D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications
    to talk to one another.</p>
<p>D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new
    hardware  device   added"  or  "printer  queue   changed")  and  a
    per-user-login-session  daemon (for general  IPC needs  among user
    applications). Also, the message bus  is built on top of a general
    one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two
    apps to  communicate directly  (without going through  the message
    bus daemon).  Currently the communicating applications  are on one
    computer,  but  TCP/IP  option  is available  and  remote  support
    planned.</p>
<p>The D-Bus  API isn't finished yet,  and the design  is by no
    means set in stone. One of  our main goals is for lots of projects
    to use it, so if you wouldn't use it, by all means mail us and say
    why -  design, licensing, indentation style, we  would rather know
    than not know.</p>
<p>D-Bus' only <span class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span> dependency is an
    XML parser (either
    libxml  or expat). D-Bus  includes many  language bindings  to the
    D-Bus system,  if you  want to build  those. The list  of projects
    using D-Bus  is growing and they  provide a wealth  of examples of
    using the various APIs to learn from.</p>
<p>Trying out  D-Bus in sample applications is  encouraged - we
      want to  get it  widely used and  tested.  It should  be working
      pretty well these  days, and when it isn't  bug reports are very
      welcome.</p>
