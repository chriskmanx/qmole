;;; COMPILING EFFECTIVE METHODS
;;;
;;; The following functions take care of transforming the forms
;;; produced by the method combinations into effective methods. In ECL
;;; effective methods are nothing but directly callable functions.
;;; Ideally, this compilation should just produce new compiled
;;; functions. However, we do not want to cons a lot of functions, and
;;; therefore we use closures.
;;;
;;; Formerly we used to keep a list of precompiled effective methods
;;; and made a structural comparison between the current method and
;;; the precompiled ones, so as to save memory. This only causes
;;; improvements in declarative combinations. For standard combinations
;;; it should be enough with a couple of different closures and hence
;;; the structural comparison is a loss of time.
;;;
;;; This is the core routine. It produces effective methods (i.e.
;;; functions) out of the forms generated by the method combinators.
;;; We consider the following cases:
;;;  1) Ordinary methods. The function of the method is extracted.
;;;  2) Functions. They map to themselves. This only happens
;;;     when these functions have been generated by previous calls
;;;     to EFFECTIVE-METHOD-FUNCTION.
;;;  3) (CALL-METHOD method rest-methods) A closure is
;;;	generated that invokes the current method while informing
;;;	it about the remaining methods.
;;;  4) (MAKE-METHOD form) A function is created that takes the
;;;	list of arguments of the generic function and evaluates
;;;	the forms in a null environment. This is the only form
;;;	that may lead to consing of new bytecodes objects. Nested
;;;	CALL-METHOD are handled via the global macro CALL-METHOD.
;;;  5) Ordinary forms are turned into lambda forms, much like
;;;	what happens with the content of MAKE-METHOD.
