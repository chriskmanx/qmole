This manual describes the Emacs auth-source library.

   It is a way for multiple applications to share a single configuration
(in Emacs and in files) for user convenience.

1 Overview
**********

The auth-source library is simply a way for Emacs and Gnus, among
others, to find the answer to the old burning question "I have a server
name and a port, what are my user name and password?"

   The auth-source library actually supports more than just the user
name (known as the login) or the password, but only those two are in use
today in Emacs or Gnus.  Similarly, the auth-source library can in
theory support multiple storage formats, but currently it only
understands the classic "netrc" format, examples of which you can see
later in this document.

"Netrc" files are a de facto standard.  They look like this:
     machine MYMACHINE login MYLOGINNAME password MYPASSWORD port MYPORT

   The machine is the server (either a DNS name or an IP address).

   The port is optional.  If it's missing, auth-source will assume any
port is OK.  Actually the port is a protocol name or a port number so
you can have separate entries for port 143 and for protocol IMAP if you
fancy that.  Anyway, you can just omit the port if you don't need it.

   The login and password are simply your login credentials to the
server.

   "Netrc" files are usually called `.authinfo' or `.netrc'; nowadays
`.authinfo' seems to be more popular and the auth-source library
encourages this confusion by making it the default, as you'll see later.

   If you have problems with the port, set `auth-source-debug' to `t'
and see what port the library is checking in the `*Messages*' buffer.
Ditto for any other problems, your first step is always to see what's
being checked.  The second step, of course, is to write a blog entry
about it and wait for the answer in the comments.

   You can customize the variable `auth-sources'.  The following may be
needed if you are using an older version of Emacs or if the auth-source
library is not loaded for some other reason.

     (require 'auth-source)             ;; probably not necessary
     (customize-variable 'auth-sources) ;; optional, do it once

 -- Variable: auth-sources
     The `auth-sources' variable tells the auth-source library where
     your netrc files live for a particular host and protocol.  While
     you can get fancy, the default and simplest configuration is:

          (setq auth-sources '((:source "~/.authinfo.gpg" :host t :protocol t)))

     This says "for any host and any protocol, use just that one file."
     Sweet simplicity.  In fact, this is already the default, so unless
     you want to move your netrc file, it will just work if you have
     that file.  You may not, though, so make sure it exists.

     By adding multiple entries to `auth-sources' with a particular
     host or protocol, you can have specific netrc files for that host
     or protocol.  Usually this is unnecessary but may make sense if
     you have shared netrc files or some other unusual setup (90% of
     Emacs users have unusual setups and the remaining 10% are _really_
     unusual).


   If you don't customize `auth-sources', you'll have to live with the
defaults: any host and any port are looked up in the netrc file
`~/.authinfo.gpg'.  This is an encrypted file if and only if you set up
EPA, which is strongly recommended.

     (require 'epa-file)
     (epa-file-enable)
     ;;; VERY important if you want symmetric encryption
     ;;; irrelevant if you don't
     (setq epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)

   The simplest working netrc line example is one without a port.

     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password YOURPASSWORD

   This will match any authentication port.  Simple, right?  But what if
there's a SMTP server on port 433 of that machine that needs a
different password from the IMAP server?

     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password SMTPPASSWORD port 433
     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password GENERALPASSWORD

   For url-auth authentication (HTTP/HTTPS), you need to put this in
your netrc file:

     machine yourmachine.com:80 port http login testuser password testpass

   This will match any realm and authentication method (basic or digest)
over HTTP.  HTTPS is set up similarly.  If you want finer controls,
explore the url-auth source code and variables.

   For Tramp authentication, use:

     machine yourmachine.com port scp login testuser password testpass

   Note that the port denotes the Tramp connection method.  When you
don't use a port entry, you match any Tramp method, as explained
earlier.  Since Tramp has about 88 connection methods, this may be
necessary if you have an unusual (see earlier comment on those) setup.

*********************

The auth-source library only has one function for external use.

 -- Function: auth-source-user-or-password mode host port
     Retrieve appropriate authentication tokens, determined by MODE,
     for host HOST and PORT.  If `auth-source-debug' is t, debugging
     messages will be printed.  Set `auth-source-debug' to a function
     to use that function for logging.  The parameters passed will be
     the same that the `message' function takes, that is, a string
     formatting spec and optional parameters.

     If MODE is a list of strings, the function will return a list of
     strings or `nil' objects (thus you can avoid parsing the netrc
     file more than once).  If it's a string, the function will return a
     string or a `nil' object.  Currently only the modes "login" and
     "password" are recognized but more may be added in the future.

     HOST is a string containing the host name.

     PORT contains the protocol name (e.g. "imap") or a port number.
     It must be a string, corresponding to the port in the users' netrc
     files.

          ;; IMAP example
          (setq auth (auth-source-user-or-password
                      '("login" "password")
                      "anyhostnamehere"
                      "imap"))
          (nth 0 auth) ; the login name
          (nth 1 auth) ; the password
