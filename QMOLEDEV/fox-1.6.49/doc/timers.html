  <p>Most messages your application will receive are
  generated from FOX Widgets, such as buttons, sliders, and other controls.&nbsp;
  However, FOX also provides some messages which are generated from other
  sources.</p>
  <p>There are four types of such messages: Timers, Chores, Signals, and Inputs.</p>

Timer Messages

</p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>Timer messages are used so your program can receive
  a message after some specified interval has elapsed. This can be very useful,
  for example for performing an animation of some kind. Like all messages, timer messages are handled
  by specifying a <i>target object </i>which is to handle the message.&nbsp;
  When the specified time has elapsed, the object will receive a message
  of the type <b>SEL_TIMEOUT,&nbsp;</b> with the message <b>ID</b> being
  the one which was registered at the beginning of the time interval.
  The length of the time interval is expressed in
  <b><i>milliseconds</i></b>,
  and the interval starts at the time the callback message was registered.&nbsp;
  The message callback to the target object will be when the interval has
  expired.</p>

  <p>Here's how you would&nbsp; program a message map
  entry to catch a timer message in a target object of type MyObject:</p>

<pre>
// Message map entry of "object"
<b>FXDEFMAP</b>(MyObject) MyObjectMap[]={
  <b>&nbsp; FXMAPFUNC</b>(SEL_TIMEOUT,MyObject::ID_ANIMATIONSTEP,MyObject::onAnimationStep),
  <b>...</b>
};

</pre>


<p>A timer may be registered with a specific target object and message-id identifying the
object and method to be invoked on that object when the timer expires.
An optional user-data pointer may be passed which is made available to the
message handler when the timer message is invoked.  This can be used by the
handler to e.g. determine what to do.
To register a timer message, you would call the function <b>FXApp::addTimeout(),
</b> as follows:</p>
<pre>
// Register Timer callback message for 1000 milliseconds
MyObject* object;
void *userdata;
app-><b>addTimeout</b>(object,ID_ANIMATIONSTEP,1000,userdata);
</pre>

If a timer with this particular target and message combination already exists,
the interval is reset to the new time.  


<p>Timers can be removed or unregistered at any time, by calling <b>FXApp::removeTimeout()</b> 
with same target and message-id with which it was registered previously:</p>

<pre>
// Unregister Timer callback message
<b>removeTimeout</b>(object,ID_ANIMATIONSTEP);
</pre>


<p>It is OK to call removeTimeout() on a timer that has already fired.
Timers in FOX are fired only once, not repeatedly; thus, to do animations
the timer must be reset each time it expires, as is done below:

<pre>
// Receive a Timer callback
long MyObject::onAnimationStep(FXObject*,FXSelector,void* ptr){
  if(continueToAnimate){
  
    // Do something ...
  
    // Restart timer for another interval, passing the user data for next time
    app->addTimeout(object,ID_ANIMATIONSTEP,1000,ptr);
    }
  return 1;
  }
  
</pre>



<p>It is OK to call <b>FXApp::removeTimeout()</b> even when the timer has
already fired.  
A typical scenario used in FOX programs is to remove any timers that may
be outstanding in the destructor of the target.<br>
Since a timer is uniquely identified by the target and message-id,
a class using timers does not need to bother with bookkeeping issues
like keeping track of which timers are still in use.
This is very convenient in destructors:

<pre>
// Destructor: just remove the timer, regarless of whether it was set
MyObject::~MyObject(){
  removeTimeout(object,ID_ANIMATIONSTEP);
  }
</pre>


  <p>Which makes for much cleaner code.</p>

  <p>Timers are <b>fired</b> when the application returns to the event loop.
  In other words, handlers may be invoked a bit later than specified by the
  timer interval. To maintain smooth animation sequences, you might
  want to call <b>gettimeofday()</b> or some equivalent function so as to
  decrease the next timer interval in the sequence a little bit to correct
  for this effect, particularly if some of your applications are CPU intensive.</p>

Chore Messages
<br><img src='art/line.gif' width=100% height=1></b></td></tr></table>
</p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>Chore messages are messages which are delivered
  to their target object when the application is about to block for events.&nbsp;
  They are used for background tasks which are to be performed when no other,
  more urgent tasks need to be performed.&nbsp; You can use chores for housekeeping
  tasks in your application, or&nbsp; perhaps for animations.&nbsp; A chore
  will fire as soon as the event stream is exhausted and there is nothing
  else for the application to do, this is why it is also sometimes referred
  to as <b><i>idle processing.</i></b></p>

  <p>When the chore message is fired, your object will
  receive a message of the type <b>SEL_CHORE,</b> with the message <b>ID</b>
  being the one which was registered.&nbsp; To intercept this message, here's
  how you would program your message map:</font></p>

<pre>
FXDEFMAP(MyObject) MyObjectMap[]={
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_CHORE,MyObject::ID_IDLETASK,MyObject::onIdleTask),
  ...
  };
</pre>


  <p>As you see, it is very similar to timer callback
  processing.&nbsp; Setting or registering a chore callback message is similar
  as well, and is done by calling <b>FXApp::addChore() </b>as shown below:</p>

<pre>
// Register Chore callback message
MyObject* object;
void *userdata;
app->addChore(object,ID_ANIMATIONSTEP,userdata);
</pre>


  <p>Chores can be unregistered at any time <b><i>prior</i></b> to being
  fired, by calling <b>FXApp::removeChore()</b> with the same target and
  message-id as was used to register it in <b>FXApp::addChore():</b></p>

<pre>
// Unregister Chore callback message
app->removeChore(object,ID_ANIMATIONSTEP);
</pre>

  <p>Like timers, it is OK to remove chores that have already fired.
  Thus, classes which are receiving chore messages can remove them
  in the destructor, regardless of whether they were set or not.  This
  can substantially simplify book keeping.</p>

  <p>Some notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Some computer graphics books describe using <b>Motif work-proc</b>'s to perform delayed 
  drawing for complicated 3D graphics. While FOX's Chores are indeed equivalent to Motif's 
  work-proc's, this is unnecessary, as ALL paint operations in the FOX toolkit are already delayed.</li>
  <li>Repeatedly resetting the chore callback will mean that your application will never yield 
  the CPU, because there will always be a chore ready to execute prior to blocking for event 
  input.</li>
  <li>The GUI update and the Chore processing are interleaved, so that each time through 
  the event loop, at least one GUI update callback and one Chore are always being executed.
  This means however, that if a Chore takes a long time, the GUI update process itself will 
  also proceed much slower, as it will proceed in lock-step with the Chore processing.</li>
  </ul>

</ul>

Signal Messages
<br><img src='art/line.gif' width=100% height=1></b></td></tr></table>
</p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>Signal messages are generated when certain asynchronous
  events happen.&nbsp; On most systems, these events are generated in the
  form of <b><i>POSIX signals</i></b>.&nbsp; The POSIX signal facility is
  available on most systems to which FOX has been ported, although&nbsp;
  non-POSIX [e.g. BSD) signals should work also.</p>

  <p>You can use Signal messages to allow FOX objects
  to receive signals and process them.&nbsp; For example, you could&nbsp;
  register a signal handler for <b>SIGINT</b>, so that an application may
  be closed down properly when the user hits <tt><b>^C</b> </tt>on the controlling
  terminal.&nbsp; Another use might be to register a handler to catch the
  <b>SIGFPE</b> during a computation, so a warning panel can be popped for
  a divide by zero, and perhaps gracefully save the user's data rather than
  core dumping.</p>

  <p>When a Signal message is sent, your target object
  will receive a message of the type <b>SEL_SIGNAL</b> with the <b>ID</b>
  being the one specified when the callback message was registered:</p>

<pre>
// Message map entry of "object"
FXDEFMAP(MyObject) MyObjectMap[]={
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_SIGNAL,MyObject::ID_INTERRUPT,MyObject::onCleanUpAndQuit),
  ...
  };
</pre>

  <p>A signal handler can be added by calling <b>FXApp::addSignal().</b>&nbsp;
  There are two methods to deliver a signal to the application: synchronously,
  and asynchronously (immediately).</p>

  <p><b>Synchronous or non-immediate</b><b>signals </b>are held until the application returns to the event loop,
  and then dispatched to the application.&nbsp; Thus, in most cases, the
  normal flow of computation in the application will not be interrupted,
  and your signal callback message handler can assume that all data structures
  are in a consistent state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively harmless signals
  such as <b>SIGINT</b> are best handled synchronously.</p>

  <p><b>Asynchronous or immediate signals </b>are dispatched
  to the target object immediately.&nbsp; Since the regular processing of
  your application may have been interrupted by the signal, you will have
  to exercise extreme caution in the handler, as data structures may be partically
  complete.&nbsp; The immediate signal handlers are best reserved for last-ditch
  efforts, such as cleaning up after a <b>SIGSEGV</b> or <b>SIGBUS</b>, when
  a grave error has occured but there may be a chance to perhaps recover
  some of the user's data.</p>

<pre>
// Register Signal callback message
app->addSignal(SIGINT,myobject,ID_INTERRUPT,FALSE,flags);
</pre>

  <p>The flags are set as for POSIX signal handling facilities, pleace confer
  your man pages for <b>sigaction(2).</b>
  <br>To remove the signal handler callback message and restore the default
  signal handling action, you can call <b>FXApp::removeSignal() </b>as follows:</p>

<pre>
// Unregister Signal callback message
app->removeSignal(SIGINT);
</pre>


</ul>

Input Messages
<br><img src='art/line.gif' width=100% height=1></b></td></tr></table>
</p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>Input messages allow your programs to receive
  inputs from other sources than the GUI.&nbsp; Input messages can for example
  be used to watch <b><i>sockets</i></b>, <b><i>pipes</i></b>, and a host
  of other <b><i>synchronization objects</i></b> [if available on your machine].</p>

  <p>Writing networked applications, such as e.g. a chat program, involves watching inputs from a number of different sources.&nbsp;
  You could have your program continuously check all these inputs for activity
  in a timer callback, but it is far more efficient to register an input
  source and yield the CPU until there is something going on.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, most operating systems provide such a facility, and FOX can take advantage of this:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>On UNIX, the <b>select()</b> system call is used.&nbsp; The select mechanism allow a group of file descriptors representing sockets, pipes, and [where supported] asynchronous files to be watched for activity.&nbsp; In fact, the connection to the display, i.e. the GUI is just one of the file descriptors that can be watched.&nbsp; Please consult your UNIX <i>select(2) </i>man pages for more information about this system call.</li>
  <li>On WIndows NT, the <b>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects()</b>
    system call is used.&nbsp; This system call waits for GUI messages, as
    well as any number of synchronization objects, such as asynchronous files,
    sockets, pipes, event objects, mutexes, and even directories.&nbsp; More
    information about this can be found on the Microsoft Developer Network
    CD's, or on their on-line version of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp">MSDN</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To register a callback message for an input source, you can call FXApp::addInput().&nbsp;
  The callback message will remain registered even even after it has fired,
  unlike for Timers and Chores which are automatically removed after being
  fired once.</p>

  <p>When a synchronization object becomes signaled, a message of the type
  SEL_IO_READ, SEL_IO_WRITE, or SEL_IO_EXCEPT will be sent to the target
  object, with the ID being the one specified in addInput().&nbsp; You can
  intercept these messages as follows:</p>

<pre>
// Message map entry of "object"
FXDEFMAP(MyObject) MyObjectMap[]={
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_IO_READ,MyObject::ID_ACCEPT,MyObject::onAcceptConnectionFromTheNet),
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_IO_READ,MyObject::ID_SOCKET,MyObject::onReceivedInputFromTheNet),
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_IO_WRITE,MyObject::ID_SOCKET,MyObject::onSendOutputToTheNet),
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_IO_EXCEPT,MyObject::ID_SOCKET,MyObject::onDealWithExcept),
  ...
  };
</pre>

  <p>In this example, a server type application may
  be creating a <b>socket</b> (socket(2)), and listen for incoming connections.&nbsp;
  When an incoming connection is received the callback handler <b>onAcceptConnectionFromTheNet</b><tt>()
  </tt>presumably verifies the request and calls <b>accept</b> (accept(2))&nbsp;
  and registers another handler to deal with incoming or outgoing data, and
  exceptional conditions.</p>

  <p>You can register a input handler by calling <b>FXApp::addInput()</b>.</p>

<pre>
// Accept the connection
socket=accept(...);

// Register input callback message
app->addInput(socket,INPUT_READ|INPUT_WRITE|INPUT_EXCEPT,myobject,ID_SOCKET);
</pre>

<br>&nbsp;

  <p>Passing <b>INPUT_READ|INPUT_WRITE|INPUT_EXCEPT</b> will register the
  same callback message handler <b>ID</b> for all three types of I/O activities.
  <br>To remove a callback message handler, you can call <b>FXApp::removeInput()
  </b>as follows:</p>

<pre>
// Unregister input callback message
app->removeInput(socket,INPUT_WRITE);
</pre>

<p>This will remove the callback message <b>ID</b> for I/O output.&nbsp;
It is usually a good idea for output, because the file descriptor will
remain signaled as long as there is buffering to accept more outgoing data.
<br>You would add the <b>INPUT_WRITE</b> back only when buffers get full
[when the other party is tardy processing the data you're sending, lets
say].</p>
