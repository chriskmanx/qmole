        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.

        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
          51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
      the version number 2.1.]

                                 Preamble

       The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
     free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

       This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
     specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
     Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
     can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
     this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
     strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
     not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
     you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
     for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
     it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
     it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
     these things.

       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
     rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
     you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

       For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
     or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
     you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
     code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
     complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
     with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
     it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

       We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
     library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
     permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

       To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
     there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
     modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
     that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
     author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
     introduced by others.

       Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
     any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
     effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
     restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
     any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
     consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

       Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
     ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
     General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
     is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
     this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
     libraries into non-free programs.

       When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
     a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
     combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
     General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
     entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
     Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
     the library.

       We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
     does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
     Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
     of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
     are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
     libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
     special circumstances.

       For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
     encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
     a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
     allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
     library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
     case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
     software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

       In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
     programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
     free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
     non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
     operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
     system.

       Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
     users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
     linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
     that program using a modified version of the Library.

       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
     "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
     former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
     be combined with the library in order to run.

                       GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

       0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
     this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
     Each licensee is addressed as "you".

       A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

       The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
     straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)

       "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
     all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
     interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
     and installation of the library.

       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
     such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
     on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
     writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
     and what the program that uses the Library does.

       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
     you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
     all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
     Library.

       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
     fee.

       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

         a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

         b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

         c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
         charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

         d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
         table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
         the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
         is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
         in the event an application does not supply such function or
         table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
         its purpose remains meaningful.

         (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
         a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
         application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
         application-supplied function or table used by this function must
         be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
         root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
     it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
     with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.

       3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
     this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
     that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
     instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
     ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
     that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
     these notices.

       Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
     subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

       This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.

       4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
     under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
     it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
     must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
     medium customarily used for software interchange.

       If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
     source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

       5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
     linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
     work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
     therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

       However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
     contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
     library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
     Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

       When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
     that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
     derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
     Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
     linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
     threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

       If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
     work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
     Library will still fall under Section 6.)

       Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
     Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

       6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

       You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
     this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
     during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
     copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
     directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
     of these things:

         a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
         machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
         changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
         Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
         with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
         uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
         user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
         executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
         that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
         Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
         to use the modified definitions.)

         b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
         copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
         rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
         will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
         the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
         interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

         c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
         least three years, to give the same user the materials
         specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
         than the cost of performing this distribution.

         d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
         from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
         specified materials from the same place.

         e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
         materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

       For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
     the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
     normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
     which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
     the executable.

       It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
     use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
     distribute.

       7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
     facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
     library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
     the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
     permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

         a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
         based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
         facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
         Sections above.

         b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
         that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
         where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

       8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
     the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
     rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
     or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

       9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Library or works based on it.

       10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
     this License.

       11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
     particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
     and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.

       12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
     an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
     so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
     written in the body of this License.

       13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
     "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
     conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
     the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
     license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
     the Free Software Foundation.

       14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
     of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                 NO WARRANTY

       15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
     LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
     THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

       16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
     LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
     RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
     FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
     SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
     DAMAGES.

                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

       If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
     everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
     redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
     ordinary General Public License).

       To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
     safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
     "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

         <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
         Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

         This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
         modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
         License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
         version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

         This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
         Lesser General Public License for more details.

         You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
         License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
         Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
       library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

       <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
       Ty Coon, President of Vice

     That's all there is to it!
