No changes since last version.


* Version 2.12.0 (released 2011-03-24)

** certtool: Warns on generation of DSA keys of over 1024 bits, about
the incompatibility with TLS other than 1.2.

** libgnutls: Modified signature algorithm selection in client
certificate request, to avoid failures in DSA certificates.

** libgnutls: Instead of failing with internal error, return 
GNUTLS_E_INCOMPAT_DSA_KEY_WITH_TLS_PROTOCOL if an incompatible DSA
key with the negotiated protocol is encountered.

** libgnutls: Bug fixes in the RSA ciphersuite behavior with openpgp keys.

** libgnutls: Force state update when fork is detected in the nettle
rng.

** libgnutls: modified gnutls_pubkey_import_openpgp() to use the preferred
subkey instead of setting explicitly one.

** libgnutls: Corrected default behavior in record version of Client Hellos.

** libgnutls-openssl: modified to use modern gnutls' functions.
This introduces an ABI incompatibility with previous versions.

* Version 2.11.7 (released 2011-03-09)

** libgnutls: Corrected signature generation and verification
in the Certificate Verify message when in TLS 1.2. Reported
by Todd A. Ouska.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue in DHE-PSK ciphersuites that ignored
the PSK callback.

They have to be explicitly set.

** libgnutls: During handshake message verification using DSS
use the hash algorithm required by it.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_hash() is deprecated.
Use gnutls_privkey_sign_hash() instead.

** libgnutls: gnutls_transport_set_lowat() is deprecated. Support
for this functionality will be dropped in later versions.

** libgnutls: gnutls_pubkey_verify_data, gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash,
gnutls_x509_privkey_verify_data, gnutls_x509_crt_verify_data, 
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash return the negative error code 
GNUTLS_E_PK_SIG_VERIFY_FAILED if verification fails to simplify error 
checking.

** libgnutls: Added helper functions for signature verification:
gnutls_pubkey_verify_data() and gnutls_pubkey_import_privkey().

** libgnutls: Modified gnutls_privkey_sign_data().

** gnutls_x509_crl_privkey_sign2(), gnutls_x509_crq_sign2()
gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_hash(), gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_data(),
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash(), gnutls_x509_crt_verify_data(), were
deprecated for gnutls_x509_crl_privkey_sign(),
gnutls_x509_crq_privkey_sign(), gnutls_privkey_sign_hash(),
gnutls_privkey_sign_data(), gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash()
gnutls_pubkey_verify_data() respectively.

** libgnutls: gnutls_*_export_raw() functions now add leading zero in
integers.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_transport_set_vec_push_function() that
can be used to specify a writev() like function. Using that gnutls
can provide more efficient writes to network layer in systems that 
support it.

** crypto.h: Fix use with C++.
Reported by "Brendan Doherty" <brendand@gentrack.com>.

* Version 2.11.6 (released 2010-12-06)

** libgnutls: Record version of Client Hellos is now set by default to
SSL 3.0. To restore the previous default behavior use %LATEST_RECORD_VERSION
priority string.

** libgnutls: Use ASN1_NULL when writing parameters for RSA signatures. 
This makes us comply with RFC3279. Reported by Michael Rommel.

** gnutls-serv: Corrected a buffer overflow. Reported and patch by Tomas Mraz.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.11.5 (released 2010-12-01)

** libgnutls: Reverted default behavior for verification and
introduced GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT. Thus by default
V1 trusted CAs are allowed, unless the new flag is specified.

** libgnutls: Correctly add leading zero to PKCS #8 encoded DSA key.
Reported by Jeffrey Walton.

** libgnutls: Added SIGN-ALL, CTYPE-ALL, COMP-ALL, and VERS-TLS-ALL
as priority strings. Those allow to set all the supported algorithms
at once.

** p11tool: Introduced. It allows manipulating pkcs 11 tokens.

** gnutls-cli: Print channel binding only in verbose mode.
Before it printed it after the 'Compression:' output, thus breaking
Emacs starttls.el string searches.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_pkcs11_token_init: New function
gnutls_pkcs11_token_set_pin: New function

* Version 2.11.4 (released 2010-10-15)

** libgnutls: Add new API gnutls_session_channel_binding.
The function is used to get the channel binding data.  Currently only
the "tls-unique" (RFC 5929) channel binding type is supported, through
the GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE type.  See new section "Channel Bindings" in
the manual.

** gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv: Print 'tls-unique' Channel Bindings.

** doc: Added pkcs11.h header file to GTK-DOC manual.

** build: Update gnulib files.

** i18n: Update translations.

** tests: Add self tests gendh.c.  Speed up Guile self checks.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_session_channel_binding: New function.
gnutls_channel_binding_t: New enumeration.
GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE: New gnutls_channel_binding_t enum member.
GNUTLS_E_CHANNEL_BINDING_NOT_AVAILABLE: New error code.

* Version 2.11.3 (released 2010-10-14)

** Indent code to follow the GNU Coding Standard.
You should be able to unpack the 2.11.2 release and run 'make indent'
twice to get exactly the same content as 2.11.3 except for generated
files.  Using GNU Indent 2.2.11.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.11.2 (released 2010-10-08)

** libgnutls: Several bug fixes on session resumption
and session tickets support.

** libgnutls: Add new extended key usage ipsecIKE.

** certtool: Renamed PKCS #11 options to: --p11-provider,
--p11-export-url, --p11-list-certs, --p11-list-certs,
--p11-list-privkeys, --p11-list-trusted, --p11-list-all-certs,
--p11-list-all, --p11-list-tokens, --p11-login, --p11-write,
--p11-write-label, --p11-write-trusted, --p11-detailed-url,
--p11-delete-url

** libgnutls: Corrected bug that caused importing DSA keys as RSA,
introduced with the new nettle code.

** libgnutls: Corrected advertizing issue for session tickets.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_unique_id: ADDED.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_unique_id: ADDED.

* Version 2.11.1 (released 2010-09-14)

** libgnutls: Nettle is the default crypto back end. Use --with-libgcrypt
to use the libgcrypt back end.

** libgnutls: Depend on nettle 2.1. This makes nettle a fully working
backend crypto library.

** libgnutls: Added RSA_NULL_SHA1 and SHA256 ciphersuites.

** libgnutls: Several updates in the buffering internal interface.

** libgnutls: Is now more liberal in the PEM decoding. That is spaces and 
tabs are being skipped.

** libgnutls: Added support for draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-02.

** libgnutls: The %COMPAT flag now allows larger records that violate the
TLS spec.

** libgnutls: by default lowat level has been set to zero to avoid unnecessary
system calls. Applications that depended on it being 1 should explicitly call
gnutls_transport_set_lowat().

** libgnutls: Updated documentation and gnutls_pk_params_t mappings
to ECRYPT II recommendations. Mappings were moved to a single location
and DSA keys are handled differently (since DSA2 allows for 1024,2048
and 3072 keys only).

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_privkey_import() will fallback to
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8() without a password, if it
is unable to decode the key.

** libgnutls: HMAC-MD5 no longer used by default.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_sec_param: ADDED
gnutls_x509_privkey_sec_param: ADDED

* Version 2.11.0 (released 2010-07-22)

** libgnutls: support scattered write using writev(). This takes
advantage of the new buffering layer and allows queuing of packets
and flushing them. This is currently used for handshake messages
only.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_global_set_mutex() to allow setting
alternative locking procedures. By default the system available
locking is used. In *NIX pthreads are used and in windows the
critical section API. This follows a different approach than the
previous versions that depended on libgcrypt initialization. The
locks are now set by default in systems that support it. Programs
that used gcry_control() to set thread locks should insert it into
a block of
#if GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER <= 0x020b00
	gcry_control(...)
#endif

** libgnutls: Added support for reading DN from EV-certificates.
New DN values:
jurisdictionOfIncorporationLocalityName,
jurisdictionOfIncorporationStateOrProvinceName,
jurisdictionOfIncorporationCountryName

** libgnutls: Added support for DSA signing/verifying with bit 
length over 1024.

** libgnutls-extra: When in FIPS mode gnutls_global_init_extra()
has to be called to register any required md5 handlers.

** libgnutls: Internal buffering code was replaced by simpler
code contributed by Jonathan Bastien-Filiatrault.

** libgnutls: Internal API for extensions augmented to allow
safe storing and loading of data on resumption. This allows writing
self-contained extensions (when possible). As a side effect
the OPRFI extension was removed.

** libgnutls: Added support for DSA-SHA256 and DSA-SHA224

** libgnutls: Added PKCS #11 support and an API to access objects in
gnutls/pkcs11.h. Currently certificates and public keys can be
imported from tokens, and operations can be performed on private keys.

** libgnutls: Added abstract gnutls_privkey_t and gnutls_pubkey_t

** libgnutls: Added initial support for the nettle library. It uses
the system's random generator for seeding. That is /dev/urandom in Linux, 
system calls in Win32 and EGD on other systems.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue on the %SSL3_RECORD_VERSION priority string. It now
    works even when resuming a session.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function() to replace the
similar gnutls_certificate_set_server_retrieve_function() and
gnutls_certificate_set_client_retrieve_function(). In addition it support
PKCS #11 private keys.

** libgnutls: Added  gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_crt(), gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_privkey(),
and gnutls_pkcs11_delete_url() to allow copying and deleting data in tokens.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits() et al. to allow select bit
sizes for private keys using a human understandable scale.

** certtool: Added new options: --pkcs11-list-tokens, --pkcs11-list-all
--pkcs11-list-all-certs, --pkcs11-list-trusted, --pkcs11-list-certs,
--pkcs11-delete-url, --pkcs11-write

certtool: The --pkcs-cipher is taken into account when generating a
private key. The default cipher used now is aes-128. The old behavior can
be simulated by specifying "--pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12".

certtool: Added --certificate-pubkey to print the public key of the
certificate.

** gnutls-cli/gnutls-serv: --x509cafile, --x509certfile and --x509keyfile
can now accept a PKCS #11 URL in addition to a file. This will allow for
example to use the Gnome-keyring trusted certificate list to verify
connections using a url such as:
pkcs11:token=Root%20CA%20Certificates;serial=1%3AROOTS%3ADEFAULT;model=1%2E0;manufacturer=Gnome%20Keyring

* Version 2.10.1 (released 2010-07-25)

** libgnutls: Added support for broken certificates that indicate RSA
with strange OIDs.

** gnutls-cli: Allow verification using V1 CAs.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_privkey_import() will fallback to
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8() without a password, if it
is unable to decode the key.

** libgnutls: Correctly deinitialize crypto API functions to prevent
a memory leak.  Reported by Mads Kiilerich.

** certtool: If asked to generate DSA keys of size more than 1024 bits,
issue a warning, that the output key might not be working everywhere.

** certtool: The --pkcs-cipher is taken into account when generating a
private key. The default cipher used now is aes-128. The old behavior
can be simulated by specifying "--pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12".

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.10.0 (released 2010-06-25)

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.12 (released 2010-06-17)

** gnutls-cli: Make --starttls work again.
Problem introduced in patch to use read() instead of fgets() committed
on 2010-01-27.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.11 (released 2010-06-07)

** libgnutls: Removed two APIs related to safe renegotiation.
Use priority strings instead.  The APIs were
gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial and gnutls_safe_renegotiation_set.
(Remember that we don't promise ABI stability during development
series, so this doesn't cause an shared library ABI increment.)

** tests: More self testing of safe renegotiation extension.
See tests/safe-renegotiation/README for more information.

** doc: a PDF version of the API reference manual (GTK-DOC) is now built.

** doc: Terms 'GNUTLS' and 'GNU TLS' were changed to 'GnuTLS' for consistency.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial: REMOVED.
gnutls_safe_renegotiation_set: REMOVED.

* Version 2.9.10 (released 2010-04-22)

** libgnutls: Time verification extended to trusted certificate list.
Unless new constant GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TRUSTED_TIME_CHECKS flag is
specified.

** certtool: Display postalCode and Name X.509 DN attributes correctly.
Based on patch by Pavan Konjarla.  Adds new constant
GNUTLS_OID_X520_POSTALCODE and GNUTLS_OID_X520_NAME.

** libgnutls: Added Steve Dispensa's patch for safe renegotiation (RFC 5746)
Solves the issue discussed in:
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03928.html> and
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03948.html>.
Note that to allow connecting to unpatched servers the full protection
is only enabled if the priority string %SAFE_RENEGOTIATION is
specified. You can check whether protection is in place by querying
gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status().  New error codes
GNUTLS_E_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION_FAILED and
GNUTLS_E_UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION_DENIED added.

** libgnutls: When checking openpgp self signature also check the signatures
** of all subkeys.
Ilari Liusvaara noticed and reported the issue and provided test
vectors as well.

** libgnutls: Added cryptodev support (/dev/crypto).
Tested with http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/cryptodev/.  Added
benchmark utility for AES.  Adds new error codes
GNUTLS_E_CRYPTODEV_IOCTL_ERROR and GNUTLS_E_CRYPTODEV_DEVICE_ERROR.

** libgnutls: Exported API to access encryption and hash algorithms.
The new API functions are gnutls_cipher_decrypt, gnutls_cipher_deinit,
gnutls_cipher_encrypt, gnutls_cipher_get_block_size,
gnutls_cipher_init, gnutls_hash, gnutls_hash_deinit, gnutls_hash_fast,
gnutls_hash_get_len, gnutls_hash_init, gnutls_hash_output,
gnutls_hmac, gnutls_hmac_deinit, gnutls_hmac_fast,
gnutls_hmac_get_len, gnutls_hmac_init, gnutls_hmac_output.  New API
constants are GNUTLS_MAC_SHA224 and GNUTLS_DIG_SHA224.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function() to allow
verification of certificate upon receipt rather than waiting until the
end of the handshake.

** libgnutls: Don't send alerts during handshake.
Instead new error code GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_SRP_USERNAME is added.

** certtool: Corrected two issues that affected certificate request generation.
(1) Null padding is added on integers (found thanks to Wilankar Trupti),
(2) In optional SignatureAlgorithm parameters field for DSA keys the DSA
parameters were added. Those were rejected by Verisign. Gnutls no longer adds 
those parameters there since other implementations don't do either and having 
them does not seem to offer anything (anyway you need the signer's certificate
to verify thus public key will be available). Found thanks to Boyan Kasarov.
This however has the side-effect that public key IDs shown by certtool are
now different than previous gnutls releases.
(3) the option --pgp-certificate-info will verify self signatures

** certtool: Allow exporting of Certificate requests on DER format.

** certtool: New option --no-crq-extensions to avoid extensions in CSRs.

** gnutls-cli: Handle reading binary data from server.
Reported by and tiny patch from Vitaly Mayatskikh
<v.mayatskih@gmail.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/4096>.

** libgnutls: Fix for memory leaks on interrupted handshake.
Reported by Tang Tong.

** libgnutls: Addition of support for TLS 1.2 signature algorithms
** extension and certificate verify field.
This requires changes for TLS 1.2 servers and clients that use

with gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested() whether the certificate
they send complies with the peer's preferences in signature
algorithms.

** libgnutls: In server side when resuming a session do not overwrite the 
** initial session data with the resumed session data.

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 in PKCS #8
** encryption.
This affects also PKCS #12 encoded files.  This adds the following new
enums: GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_192_CBC, GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_128,
GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_192, GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_256.

** libgnutls: Fix PKCS#12 encoding.
The error you would get was "The OID is not supported.".  Problem
introduced for the v2.8.x branch in 2.7.6.

** certtool: Added the --pkcs-cipher option.
To explicitely specify the encryption algorithm to use.

** tests: Added "pkcs12_encode" self-test to check PKCS#12 functions.

gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate: ADDED.
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_client: ADDED.
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server: ADDED.

* Version 2.9.2 (released 2009-08-14)

** libgnutls: Fix problem with NUL bytes in X.509 CN and SAN fields.
By using a NUL byte in CN/SAN fields, it was possible to fool GnuTLS
into 1) not printing the entire CN/SAN field value when printing a
certificate and 2) cause incorrect positive matches when matching a
hostname against a certificate.  Some CAs apparently have poor
checking of CN/SAN values and issue these (arguable invalid)
certificates.  Combined, this can be used by attackers to become a
MITM on server-authenticated TLS sessions.  The problem is mitigated
since attackers needs to get one certificate per site they want to
attack, and the attacker reveals his tracks by applying for a
certificate at the CA.  It does not apply to client authenticated TLS
sessions.  Research presented independently by Dan Kaminsky and Moxie
Marlinspike at BlackHat09.  Thanks to Tomas Hoger <thoger@redhat.com>
for providing one part of the patch.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-4] [CVE-2009-2730].

** libgnutls: Fix rare failure in gnutls_x509_crt_import.
The function may fail incorrectly when an earlier certificate was
imported to the same gnutls_x509_crt_t structure.

** minitasn1: Internal copy updated to libtasn1 v2.3.

** libgnutls: Fix return value of gnutls_certificate_client_get_request_status.
Before it always returned false.  Reported by Peter Hendrickson
<pdh@wiredyne.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3668>.

** libgnutls: Fix off-by-one size computation error in unknown DN printing.
The error resulted in truncated strings when printing unknown OIDs in
X.509 certificate DNs.  Reported by Tim Kosse
<tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3651>.

** libgnutls: Fix PKCS#12 decryption from password.
The encryption key derived from the password was incorrect for (on
average) 1 in every 128 input for random inputs.  Reported by "Kukosa,
Tomas" <tomas.kukosa@siemens-enterprise.com> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1663>.

** libgnutls: Return correct bit lengths of some MPIs.
gnutls_dh_get_prime_bits, gnutls_rsa_export_get_modulus_bits, and
gnutls_dh_get_peers_public_bits.  Before the reported value was
overestimated.  Reported by Peter Hendrickson <pdh@wiredyne.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3607>.

** libgnutls: Avoid internal error when invoked after GNUTLS_E_AGAIN.
Report and patch by Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3671>
and
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3670>.

** libgnutls: Relax checking of required libtasn1/libgcrypt versions.
Before we required that the runtime library used the same (or more
recent) libgcrypt/libtasn1 as it was compiled with.  Now we just check
that the runtime usage is above the minimum required.  Reported by
Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> via Andreas Metzler
<ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in <http://bugs.debian.org/540449>.

** tests: Added new self-test pkcs12_s2k_pem to detect MPI bit length error.

** tests: Improved test vectors in self-test pkcs12_s2k.

* Version 2.8.6 (released 2010-03-15)

** libgnutls: For CSRs, don't null pad integers for RSA/DSA value.
VeriSign rejected CSRs with this padding.  Reported by Wilankar Trupti
<trupti.wilankar@hp.com> and Boyan Kasarov <bkasarov@gmail.com>.

Note: As a side effect of this change, the "public key identifier"
value computed for a certificate using this version of GnuTLS will be
different from values computed using earlier versions of GnuTLS.

** libgnutls: For CSRs on DSA keys, don't add DSA parameters to the
** optional SignatureAlgorithm parameter field.
VeriSign rejected these CSRs.  They are stricly speaking not needed
since you need the signer's certificate to verify the certificate
signature anyway.  Reported by Wilankar Trupti
<trupti.wilankar@hp.com> and Boyan Kasarov <bkasarov@gmail.com>.

** libgnutls: When checking openpgp self signature also check the signatures

*** minitasn1: Internal copy updated to libtasn1 v2.1.

*** examples: Now released into the public domain.

*** The Texinfo and GTK-DOC manuals were improved.

*** Several self-tests were added and others improved.

*** API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.8 compared to GnuTLS 2.6.x
No offically supported interfaces have been modified or removed.  The
library should be completely backwards compatible on both the source
and binary level.

The shared library no longer exports some symbols that have never been
officially supported, i.e., not mentioned in any of the header files.
The symbols are:

  _gnutls*
  gnutls_asn1_tab
  
Normally when symbols are removed, the shared library version has to
be incremented.  This leads to a significant cost for everyone using
the library.  Because none of the above symbols have ever been
intended for use by well-behaved applications, we decided that the it
would be better for those applications to pay the price rather than
incurring problems on the majority of applications.

If it turns out that applications have been using unofficial
interfaces, we will need to release a follow-on release on the v2.8
branch to exports additional interfaces.  However, initial testing
suggests that few if any applications have been using any of the
internal symbols.

Although not a new change compared to 2.6.x, we'd like to remind you
interfaces have been modified so that X.509 chain verification now
also checks activation/expiration times on certificates.  The affected
functions are:

gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: CHANGED, checks activation/expiration times.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers: Likewise.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2: Likewise.
GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS: ADDED.

This change in behaviour was made during the GnuTLS 2.6.x cycle, and
we gave our rationale for it in earlier release notes.

The following symbols have been added to the library:

gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_mem: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_authority_key_id: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_data: ADDED

gnutls_x509_crq_get_basic_constraints: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_extension_by_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_extension_data: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_extension_info: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_id: ADDED.
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_purpose_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_rsa_raw: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_usage: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_name: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_othername_oid: ADDED

The following interfaces have been added to the header files:

GNUTLS_VERSION: ADDED, replaces LIBGNUTLS_VERSION.
GNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR: ADDED, replaces LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR.

* Version 2.7.8 (released 2009-05-03)

** libgnutls: Fix DSA key generation.
Merged from stable branch.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-2] [CVE-2009-1416]

** libgnutls: Check expiration/activation time on untrusted certificates.
Merged from stable branch.  Reported by Romain Francoise
<romain@orebokech.com>.  This changes the semantics of
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify, which in turn is used by
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers and gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2.
We add two new gnutls_certificate_status_t codes for reporting the new
error condition, GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED and GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED.
We also add a new gnutls_certificate_verify_flags flag,
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS, that can be used to disable the new
behaviour.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-3] [CVE-2009-1417]

** lib: Linker version scripts reduces number of exported symbols.
The linker version script now lists all exported ABIs explicitly, to
avoid accidentally exporting unintended functions.  Compared to
before, most symbols beginning with _gnutls* are no longer exported.
These functions have never been intended for use by applications, and
there were no prototypes for these function in the public header
files.  Thus we believe it is possible to do this without incrementing
the library ABI version which normally has to be done when removing an
interface.

** lib: Limit exported symbols on systems without LD linker scripts.
Before all symbols were exported.  Now we limit the exported symbols
to (for libgnutls and libgnutls-extra) gnutls* and (for libgnutls)
_gnutls*.  This is a superset of the actual supported ABI, but still
an improvement compared to before.  This is implemented using Libtool
-export-symbols-regex.  It is more portable than linker version
scripts.

** libgnutls: Incremented CURRENT/AGE libtool version to reflect new symbols.
This should have been done in the last release.

** gnutls-serv: Listen on all interfaces, including both IPv4 and IPv6.
Reported by Peter Hendrickson <pdh@wiredyne.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3476>.

** doc: Improved sections for the info manual.
We now follow the advice given by the texinfo manual on which
directory categories to use.  In particular, libgnutls moved from the
'GNU Libraries' section to the 'Software libraries' and the command
line tools moved from 'Network Applications' to 'System
Administration'.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: CHANGED, checks activation/expiration times.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers: Likewise.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2: Likewise.
GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS: ADDED.

* Version 2.7.7 (released 2009-04-20)

** libgnutls: Applied patch by Cedric Bail to add functions
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash() and gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm().

** gnutls.pc: Add -ltasn1 to 'pkg-config --libs --static gnutls' output.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3467>.

** minitasn1: Internal copy updated to libtasn1 v1.8.
GnuTLS is also internally ready to be used with libtasn1 v2.0.

** doc: Fix build failure of errcodes/printlist.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3435>.

** i18n: The GnuTLS gettext domain is now 'libgnutls' instead of 'gnutls'.
It is currently only used by the core library.  This will enable a new
domain 'gnutls' for translations of the command line tools.

** Corrected possible memory corruption on signature verification failure. 
Reported by Miroslav Kratochvil <exa.exa@gmail.com>

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm: ADDED

* Version 2.7.6 (released 2009-02-27)

** certtool: Query for multiple dnsName subjectAltName in interactive mode.
This applies both to generating certificates and certificate requests.

** pkix.asn: Removed unneeded definitions to reduce memory usage.

** gnutls-cli: No longer accepts V1 CAs by default during X.509 chain verify.
Use --priority NORMAL:%VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT to permit V1 CAs to
be used for chain verification.

** gnutls-serv: No longer disable MAC padding by default.
Use --priority NORMAL:%COMPAT to disable MAC padding again.

** gnutls-cli: Certificate information output format changed.
The tool now uses libgnutls' functions to print certificate
information.  This avoids code duplication.

** libgnutls: New priority strings %VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5
** and %VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT.
They can be used to override the default certificate chain validation
behaviour.

** libgnutls: Added %SSL3_RECORD_VERSION priority string that allows to 
specify the client hello message record version. Used to overcome buggy 
TLS servers. Report by Martin von Gagern.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_print prints signature algorithm in oneline mode.

** libgnutls: gnutls_openpgp_crt_print supports oneline mode.

** doc: Update gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv --help output descriptions.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.7.5 (released 2009-02-06)

** libgnutls: Accept chains where intermediary certs are trusted.
Before GnuTLS needed to validate the entire chain back to a
self-signed certificate.  GnuTLS will now stop looking when it has
found an intermediary trusted certificate.  The new behaviour is
useful when chains, for example, contains a top-level CA, an
intermediary CA signed using RSA-MD5, and an end-entity certificate.
To avoid chain validation errors due to the RSA-MD5 cert, you can
explicitly add the intermediary RSA-MD5 cert to your trusted certs.
The signature on trusted certificates are not checked, so the chain
has a chance to validate correctly.  Reported by "Douglas E. Engert"
<deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: result_size in gnutls_hex_encode now holds
the size of the result. Report by John Brooks <special@dereferenced.net>.

** libgnutls: gnutls_handshake when sending client hello during a
rehandshake, will not offer a version number larger than the current.
Reported by Tristan Hill <stan@saticed.me.uk>.

** libgnutls: Permit V1 Certificate Authorities properly.
Before they were mistakenly rejected even though
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT and/or
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT were supplied.  Reported by
"Douglas E. Engert" <deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.7.4 (released 2009-01-07)

** libgnutls: deprecate X.509 validation chains using MD5 and MD2 signatures.
This is a bugfix -- the previous attempt to do this from internal x509
certificate verification procedures did not return the correct value
for certificates using a weak hash.  Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
<dkg@fifthhorseman.net> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3332>,
debugged and patch by Tomas Mraz <tmraz@redhat.com> and Daniel Kahn
Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>.

** libgnutls: New interface to get key id for certificate requests.
Patch from David Marín Carreño <davefx@gmail.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3321>.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crq_print will now also print public key id.

** certtool: --verify-chain now prints results of using library verification.
Earlier, certtool --verify-chain used its own validation algorithm
which wasn't guaranteed to give the same result as the libgnutls
internal validation algorithm.  Now this command print a new final
line with header 'Chain verification output:' that contains the result
from using the internal verification algorithm on the same chain.

** tests: Add crq_key_id self-test of gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_id.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_id: ADDED.

* Version 2.7.3 (released 2008-12-10)

** libgnutls: Fix chain verification for chains that ends with RSA-MD2 CAs.
Reported by Michael Kiefer <Michael-Kiefer@web.de> in
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507633> forwarded by
Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3309>.

** libgnutls: Libgcrypt initialization changed.
If libgcrypt has not already been initialized, GnuTLS will now
initialize libgcrypt with disabled secure memory.  Initialize
libgcrypt explicitly in your application if you want to enable secure
memory.  Before GnuTLS initialized libgcrypt to use GnuTLS's memory
allocation functions, which doesn't use secure memory, so there is no
real change in behaviour.

** libgnutls: Fix memory leak in PSK authentication.
Reported by Michael Weiser <michael@weiser.dinsnail.net> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1465>.

** libgnutls: Small byte reads via gnutls_record_recv() optimized.

** certtool: Move gcry_control(GCRYCTL_ENABLE_QUICK_RANDOM, 0) call earlier.
It needs to be invoked before libgcrypt is initialized.

** gnutls-cli: Return non-zero exit code on error conditions.

** gnutls-cli: Corrected bug which caused a rehandshake request to be ignored.

** tests: Added chainverify self-test that tests X.509 chain verifications.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.7.2 (released 2008-11-18)

** libgnutls: Fix X.509 certificate chain validation error. [GNUTLS-SA-2008-3]
The flaw makes it possible for man in the middle attackers (i.e.,
active attackers) to assume any name and trick GnuTLS clients into
trusting that name.  Thanks for report and analysis from Martin von
Gagern <Martin.vGagern@gmx.net>.  [CVE-2008-4989]

* Version 2.6.6 (released 2009-04-30)

** libgnutls: Corrected double free on signature verification failure.
Reported by Miroslav Kratochvil <exa.exa@gmail.com>.  See the advisory
for more details.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-1] [CVE-2009-1415]

** libgnutls: Fix DSA key generation.
Noticed when investigating the previous GNUTLS-SA-2009-1 problem.  All
DSA keys generated using GnuTLS 2.6.x are corrupt.  See the advisory
for more details.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-2] [CVE-2009-1416]

** libgnutls: Check expiration/activation time on untrusted certificates.
Reported by Romain Francoise <romain@orebokech.com>.  Before the
library did not check activation/expiration times on certificates, and
was documented as not doing so.  We have realized that many
applications that use libgnutls, including gnutls-cli, fail to perform
proper checks.  Implementing similar logic in all applications leads
to code duplication.  Hence, we decided to check whether the current
time (as reported by the time function) is within the
activation/expiration period of certificates when verifying untrusted
certificates.

This changes the semantics of gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify, which in
turn is used by gnutls_certificate_verify_peers and
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2.  We add two new
gnutls_certificate_status_t codes for reporting the new error
condition, GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED and GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED.  We also
add a new gnutls_certificate_verify_flags flag,
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS, that can be used to disable the new
behaviour.

More details about the vulnerabilities will be posted at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>.

* Version 2.6.5 (released 2009-04-11)

** libgnutls: Added %SSL3_RECORD_VERSION priority string that allows to
specify the client hello message record version. Used to overcome buggy
TLS servers. Report by Martin von Gagern.

** GnuTLS no longer uses the libtasn1-config script to find libtasn1.
Libtasn1 0.3.4 or later is required.  This is to align with the
upcoming libtasn1 v2.0 release that doesn't have a libtasn1-script.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.6.4 (released 2009-02-06)

** libgnutls: Accept chains where intermediary certs are trusted.
Before GnuTLS needed to validate the entire chain back to a
self-signed certificate.  GnuTLS will now stop looking when it has
found an intermediary trusted certificate.  The new behaviour is
useful when chains, for example, contains a top-level CA, an
intermediary CA signed using RSA-MD5, and an end-entity certificate.
To avoid chain validation errors due to the RSA-MD5 cert, you can
explicitly add the intermediary RSA-MD5 cert to your trusted certs.
The signature on trusted certificates are not checked, so the chain
has a chance to validate correctly.  Reported by "Douglas E. Engert"
<deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: result_size in gnutls_hex_encode now holds
the size of the result. Report by John Brooks <special@dereferenced.net>.

** libgnutls: gnutls_handshake when sending client hello during a
rehandshake, will not offer a version number larger than the current.
Reported by Tristan Hill <stan@saticed.me.uk>.

** libgnutls: Permit V1 Certificate Authorities properly.
Before they were mistakenly rejected even though
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT and/or

** libgnutls: deprecate X.509 validation chains using MD5 and MD2 signatures.
This is a bugfix -- the previous attempt to do this from internal x509
certificate verification procedures did not return the correct value
for certificates using a weak hash.  Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor

* Version 2.6.1 (released 2008-11-10)

** libgnutls: Fix X.509 certificate chain validation error. [GNUTLS-SA-2008-3]
The flaw makes it possible for man in the middle attackers (i.e.,
active attackers) to assume any name and trick GnuTLS clients into
trusting that name.  Thanks for report and analysis from Martin von
Gagern <Martin.vGagern@gmx.net>.  [CVE-2008-4989]

Any updates with more details about this vulnerability will be added

* Version 2.6.0 (released 2008-10-06)

** libgnutls: Correct printing and parsing of IPv6 addresses.

** libgnutls-openssl: fix out of bounds access.
Problem in X509_get_subject_name and X509_get_issuer_name.  Tiny patch
from Thomas Viehmann <tv@beamnet.de>.

** certtool: Use inet_pton for parsing IPv6 addresses.

** Major changes compared to the v2.4 branch:

*** Added API to replace and update the crypto backend.

*** certtool: can add several subject alternative names via template file.

*** opencdk: Parse (but not decrypt) encrypted secret keys.

*** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name() was added that can
either set or append alternative names. It can also handle binary structures
such as IP addresses.

*** libgnutls: New function to set minimum acceptable SRP bits.
The function is gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits.

*** libgnutls: Add interface to deal with public key and signature algorithms.
The functions are called gnutls_pk_list, gnutls_pk_get_id,
gnutls_sign_list, and gnutls_sign_get_id.

*** libgnutls: New interfaces to get name of public key and signing algorithms.
The functions are gnutls_sign_get_name and gnutls_pk_get_name.

*** libgnutls: New API to get a string corresponding to a error symbol.
The function is gnutls_strerror_name.

*** libgnutls: New API to set the public parameters in a certificate request
*** from a private key.
The function is gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_rsa_raw.

*** libgnutls: New API to set a callback to extract TLS Finished data.
The function to register is gnutls_session_set_finished_function and
it takes a callback of the gnutls_finished_callback_func type.

*** libgnutls: Fix namespace problem with TLS_MASTER_SIZE and TLS_RANDOM_SIZE.

*** libgnutls: New interface to register a new TLS extension handler.
The new function gnutls_ext_register can be used to register handlers
for specific TLS extension types.  The callback functions have the new
types gnutls_ext_recv_func and gnutls_ext_send_func.  A type to
classify TLS extensions, gnutls_ext_parse_type_t, has been added as
well.

*** libgnutls-extra: Add function to work with Libgcrypt in FIPS mode.
The function is gnutls_register_md5_handler.  When libgcrypt is in
FIPS mode, MD5 is disabled, but TLS normally requires use of MD5 in
the PRF.

*** API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.6
No functions have been removed or modified.  The library should be
fully backwards compatible on both the source and binary level.

A new header file <gnutls/crypto.h> have been added.  It contains
definitions related to replacing the internal crypto functionality.
All definitions and the header itself is experimental but supported.

We have realized that the symbols TLS_MASTER_SIZE and TLS_RANDOM_SIZE
does not use the normal namespace.  We have added GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE
and GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE, but the old symbols are still defined.

The following functions have been added to libgnutls:

GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE
GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE
gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2
gnutls_crypto_cipher_register2
gnutls_crypto_digest_register2
gnutls_crypto_mac_register2

gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_rsa_raw
gnutls_x509_crt_set_crl_dist_points2
gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name

The following functions have been added to libgnutls-extra:

gnutls_register_md5_handler

The parameters are now allocated in the structure itself.

** doc: Texinfo HTML manual uses a stylesheet to improve readability.

** tests: Scripts now use EXEEXT properly.
Modern libtool doesn't create wrapper script, so the self tests need
to invoke certtool.exe under MinGW32+Wine.

** Uses autoconf 2.63, automake 1.10.1, libtool 2.2.6a.
Automake warnings are now also enabled.

** API and ABI modifications:

Koch <wk@gnupg.org>.

** libgnutls-extra: Add function to work with Libgcrypt in FIPS mode.
The function is gnutls_register_md5_handler.  When libgcrypt is in

** libgnutls: Fix segmentation fault when generating private keys.
Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg-debian.org@fifthhorseman.net>.

** libgnutls: Remove code to import certificate chains in PKCS#7 format.
The code has not worked since v0.9.0 and apparently nobody has missed
it, so we decided to remove the code rather than fix it.  If you have
old certificate chains stored in PKCS#7 format, you can convert them
to a list of PEM certificates by using 'certtool --p7-info'.  Reported
by Christian Grothoff <christian@grothoff.org>.

** opencdk: Parse (but not decrypt) encrypted secret keys.
Contributed by Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg-debian.org@fifthhorseman.net>.

** Doc fixes.
Reference to NIST SP 800-57 in the manual on key size recommendations.
Added 'Since:' tags to new APIs for gtk-doc.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.5.3 (released 2008-08-14)

** libgnutls: New API to set the public parameters in a certificate request
** from a private key.
The function is gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_rsa_raw.  Inspired by
discussion with "Zach C." <fxchip@gmail.com>.

** libgnutls: New API to set a callback to extract TLS Finished data.
The function to register is gnutls_session_set_finished_function and
it takes a callback of the gnutls_finished_callback_func type.

** libgnutls: Drop final comma after GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_UNSIGNED_FULL in enum.
Reported in <https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106453>.

** libgnutls: Fix namespace problem with TLS_MASTER_SIZE and TLS_RANDOM_SIZE.
The new names are GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE and GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE.  The old
names are mapped to the new names in compat.h.  These mappings will
likely be removed more quickly than other mappings in that file due to
the namespace violation.

** libgnutlsxx: Make it build when SRP is disabled.

** doc: Add doxygen files in doc/doxygen/.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_rsa_raw: ADDED

* Version 2.5.2 (released 2008-07-08)

** libgnutls: Fix bug in gnutls_dh_params_generate2.
The prime and generator was swapped.

** libgnutls: New interface to register a new TLS extension handler.
The new function gnutls_ext_register can be used to register handlers
for specific TLS extension types.  The callback functions have the new
types gnutls_ext_recv_func and gnutls_ext_send_func.  A type to
classify TLS extensions, gnutls_ext_parse_type_t, has been added as
well.

** Move more code for TLS/IA extension from libgnutls to libgnutls-extra.
This was made possible by using the new gnutls_ext_register interface.
The TLS/IA functionality has only been supported through the
libgnutls-extra library, so it makes sense for the code to belong
there too.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_ext_recv_func: ADDED
gnutls_ext_send_func: ADDED
gnutls_ext_parse_type_t: ADDED
gnutls_ext_register: ADDED

** Port fixes from v2.4.1 release, see below.

** Added API to replace and update the crypto backend.
The header gnutls/crypto.h is now officially supported, and declares
the symbols below.

** Rewritten opencdk crypto backend, to use the gnutls internal one.

** Update gnulib and translations.
The gnulib gc crypto code has been removed since it was never finished
and is no longer even used.  An internal non-libgcrypt crypto
implementation may be added in the future, but we'll decide that later
on.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2: ADDED.

* Version 2.4.0 (released 2008-06-19)

** Major changes compared to the v2.2 branch:

*** The OpenPGP sub-system has been improved and now supports subkeys.

*** The PSK sub-system has been improved and now supports password
*** derivation and PSK identity hints.
The password derivation algorithms support is documented in
draft-ietf-netconf-tls-02.txt.

*** The certtool --inder and --outder has been replaced by --inraw and --outraw.
This aligns terminology with OpenPGP, which doesn't use DER encoding.
The old parameters will continue to work for some time.

*** Certtool now confirm passwords and changes permissions of private key files.

*** The default handshake size limit has been increased to 48kb.
It appears as if some valid handshakes are large due to sending many
CA certificates.  (The earlier limit was 16kb.)

*** LZO compression is now disabled by default.
The main reason is that LZO compression in TLS is not standardized,
but license compatiblity issues with minilzo triggered us to make this
decision now.

*** Improvements for cross-compilation to Windows and OpenWRT.

*** The look of the GTK-DOC manual has been improved.
Major developer visible changes compared to the v2.2 branch:

*** Full OpenPGP support is part of libgnutls, licensed under the LGPL.

*** New APIs to access the raw X.509 Subject and Issuer DN's and
*** elements from the certificate credentials structure.
Thanks to Joe Orton.

*** New APIs to improve working with username/passwords and PSK.

*** Names of constants to affect certificate printing changed.
The constants are used for OpenPGP too, which the names didn't
reflect, so the following name change has been made:

            Old name                         New name
     GNUTLS_X509_CRT_FULL            GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_FULL
     GNUTLS_X509_CRT_ONELINE         GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_ONELINE
     GNUTLS_X509_CRT_UNSIGNED_FULL   GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_UNSIGNED_FULL

The old names will be mapped to the new names for some time.

*** The function gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_id has been renamed to
*** gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_key_id.
A compatibility mapping exists to avoid breaking API backwards
compatibility.

*** Replaced all uses of alloca with malloc and free.

*** We no longer build with -D_REENTRANT -D_THREAD_SAFE.
We have been unable to find a documented rationale for this practice.

*** Of course, many smaller fixes have been made, see the ChangeLog file.

*** API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.4
All OpenPGP related functions have been moved from libgnutls-extra to
libgnutls, and several new functions have been added (see below).
Before making the release, we discussed whether moving functions from
libgnutls-extra to libgnutls would require us to increment the ABI
version, but the general opinion was that this would not be required.
All older functions continue to work the same.  We are open to the
possibility that this decision will lead to problem on some platform,
and if it turns out that the Right Thing should have been to increment
the shared library version, we would need to release an update within
the 2.4.x branch that increments the shared library version.

This release adds the following functions:

  gnutls_psk_client_get_hint
  gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint
  gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key

    Used to get/set the PSK identity hint, and derive PSK keys from
    passwords a'la netconf.

  gnutls_x509_dn_deinit
  gnutls_x509_dn_export
  gnutls_x509_dn_import
  gnutls_x509_dn_init

    Used to handle X.509 Certificate DN's directly.

  gnutls_hex2bin

    Converts a data buffer to hex.  Useful for handling PSK/SRP shared
    secrets.

  gnutls_certificate_get_x509_cas
  gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crls
  gnutls_certificate_get_openpgp_keyring

    Functions for direct access to credential elements.

  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_auth_subkey
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_key_id
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_pk_dsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_pk_rsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_preferred_key_id
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_revoked_status
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_count
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_creation_time
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_expiration_time
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_fingerprint
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_id
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_idx
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_pk_algorithm
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_pk_dsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_pk_rsa_raw

  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_usage
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_print
  gnutls_openpgp_crt_set_preferred_key_id
  gnutls_openpgp_keyring_get_crt
  gnutls_openpgp_keyring_get_crt_count
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_export
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_export_dsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_export_rsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_export_subkey_dsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_export_subkey_rsa_raw
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_fingerprint
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_key_id
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_pk_algorithm
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_preferred_key_id
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_revoked_status
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_subkey_count
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_subkey_creation_time
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_subkey_expiration_time
  gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_subkey_fingerprint

    New OpenPGP related functions.

    The function gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_key_id is the same as the old
    from gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_id, see above.

The release also adds a new header file 'gnutls/crypto.h', however it
is currently not used.

** libgnutls [OpenPGP]: New APIs to retrieve fingerprint from OpenPGP subkeys.
Contributed by Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg-debian.org@fifthhorseman.net>.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_fingerprint: ADDED.
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_subkey_fingerprint: ADDED.

* Version 2.3.15 (released 2008-06-15)

** Disable the openpgp-certs self-tests.
It results in failure under Wine and doesn't work on Debian buildds.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.14 (released 2008-06-11)

** libgnutls [OpenPGP]: Changed OpenPGP verification behaviour.
An OpenPGP certificate is now only considered verified if all the user
IDs are verified.

** Examples: Make C++ example compile.
Earlier it may have failed with an unresolved reference to strlen.

** Documentation: Doc fix for gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_oid.
Reported by Sam Varshavchik <mrsam@courier-mta.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.13 (released 2008-06-07)

** libgnutls [OpenPGP]: Make OpenPGP handshakes work again.

** doc/: Add psktool to info index.  Some minor cleanups.

** tests/: Added non-forking TLS handshake test, see tests/mini.c.

** tests/: Added libgcrypt.supp which can be used with valgrind.
The file suppresses the known libgcrypt memory leaks, so they aren't
printed when you run valgrind on the gnutls self-tests.  Use it as
follows: valgrind --suppressions=libgcrypt.supp ./x509self or add
'--suppressions=/home/you/src/gnutls/tests/libgcrypt.supp' to your
~/.valgrindrc file.

** tests/: Reduce amount of debugging output by default.
Use --verbose for each test to get the full output.

** tests/: Fix memory leaks in several self-tests.
None of the self tests should be leaking memory when running valgrind
or similar tools.  (Known exceptions are dhepskself, pskself, and
set_pkcs12_cred, which appear likely to be due to memory leaks in the
library.)

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.12 (released 2008-06-04)

** Merge gnutls_with_netconf branch.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: New API to retrieve PSK identity hint in client.
The function is gnutls_psk_client_get_hint.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: New API to set PSK identity hint in server.
The function is gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: Support server key exchange with PSK identity hint.
In the client, the message is parsed and the application can use
gnutls_psk_client_get_hint to retrieve the hint.  In the server, the
message is sent if the application has specified a PSK identity hint
using gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: Support Netconf PSK key derivation.
The function gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key supports the PSK key
derivation as specified in draft-ietf-netconf-tls-02.txt.  New self
test netconf-psk.c.

*** psktool: Support new --netconf-hint to generate PSK key from password.
Uses the Netconf algorithm to derive PSK key from password.

*** gnutls-serv: Support new --pskhint parameter to set PSK identity hint.

*** gnutls-cli: Always support PSK modes, through a callback.
The callback will derive a PSK key using Netconf algorithm.  It will
print the PSK identity hint to help the user.

*** New PSK example client and server.
See doc/examples/ex-client-psk.c and doc/examples/ex-serv-psk.c.

** libgnutls: Fix gnutls_x509_crl_set_version on arm platforms.
The code didn't work properly on platforms where 'char' is unsigned,
when you set version 0.  Reported by Laurence Withers
<l@lwithers.me.uk> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2825>.

** libgnutls-openssl: added RAND_pseudo_bytes API.
Patch from Robert Millan <rmh@aybabtu.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
RAND_pseudo_bytes: ADDED to libgnutls-openssl.
gnutls_psk_client_get_hint: ADDED.
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint: ADDED.
gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key: ADDED

* Version 2.3.11 (released 2008-05-20)

** Fix flaw in fix for GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3.
The flaw would result in incorrectly terminated sessions with the
error "Decryption has failed" when the server sends a small packet
(typically when the session is closed).  Reported by Andreas Metzler
<ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2807>.

** Don't use gnulib headers when building C++ library.
Fixes builds under Windows.

** Make umask a requirement.
We don't know of any system that lacks it, even GNU CoreUtils use it
unconditionally.

** Update gnulib files.
Fixes a problem where it pulled in a replacement for memcmp under
MinGW, which caused the C++ example to fail to build.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.10 (released 2008-05-19)

** Added wide wildcard hostname matching.
Tiny patch by Jean-Philippe Garcia Ballester.

** Fix three security vulnerabilities.  [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
Thanks to CERT-FI for finding the bugs and providing detailed reports,
which allowed the bugs to be reproduced and fixed easily.  Patches
developed by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.  Any updates
with more details about these vulnerabilities will be added to
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.

** libgnutlsxx: Updated API according to patches from Eduardo 
Villanueva Che (discussion at
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2007-02/msg00017.html>)

** Use umask to restrict permissions to owner before creating a file.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.9 (released 2008-05-16)

** libgnutls: Fix build failures if SRP/OpenPGP is disabled.
Based on report and tiny patches from
<jared.jennings.ctr@eglin.af.mil>, see
<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?106342>.

** libgnutls: Translation fixes.

** gnutls-cli: Fix so that PSK authentication works.
Also improve manual to give example for gnutls-cli PSK authentication.

** certtool: Encrypting a private key now require a confirmed password.
Before './certtool -k -8' would merely ask for a password once.
Reported by Daniel 'NebuchadnezzaR' Dehennin
<nebuchadnezzar@asgardr.info> see
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=364287>.

** certtool: When writing private keys to files, change permissions of file.
Now the file which the private key is saved to is chmod'ed 0600.
Reported by martin f krafft <madduck@debian.org> see
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=373169>.

** guile: Fix -fgnu89-inline test.

** Removed --enable-profile-mode.
The code linked gnutls with the libfc project (Function Check) which
appears to have been stalled since around 2002.

** Clean up header file checks by ./configure.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.8 (released 2008-04-29)

** libgnutls: Increase default handshake packet size limit to 48kb.
The old limit was 16kb and some servers send huge list of trusted CAs,
thus running into the limit.  FYI, applications can further increase
this limit using gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length.  Thanks to
Marc Haber <mh+debian-bugs@zugschlus.de> and "Marc F. Clemente"
<marc@mclemente.net> for reporting and providing test servers.

** libgnutls: Add new error code: GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE
Returned when the handshake data size is too large.  Before
GNUTLS_E_MEMORY_ERROR was used, which could be confused with other
error situations.

** libgnutls: Hide definitions in crypto.h.
We have decided that the APIs defined in crypto.h are not stable
enough for v2.4, so don't use any of those functions.

** gnutls-cli: exit when hostname doesn't match certificate.
Use --insecure to avoid hostname comparison.

** certtool: --inder and --outder replaced by --inraw and --outraw.
The reason is to align terminology with OpenPGP, which doesn't use
DER.  The old parameters will continue to work for some time.

** doc: Add section 'Index of new symbols in 2.4.0' to the GTK-DOC manual.

** doc: Many cosmetic fixes, to silence (most) gtk-doc warnings.

** Mingw32: Revert libgcrypt vasprintf work-around added in last release.
Use libgcrypt 1.4.1 or later when building on MinGW32, it removes the
vasprintf symbol from the libgcrypt library which caused problems.

** Update of gnulib files.

** tests: New self-test of crypto.h RNG code tests/crypto_rng.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE: ADDED.

* Version 2.3.7 (released 2008-04-21)

** opencdk now properly sets the key usage bits into openpgp keys.

** gnutls-cli: Fix crash on TLS handshake failures.
Reported by "Marc F. Clemente" <marc@mclemente.net> in Debian BTS #466477.
This is similar to <http://bugs.debian.org/429183>.

** certtool: with --generate-request and newly generated keys, print the key.

** Build fixes for MinGW.
Missing rpl_fseeko symbol in lib/opencdk/.  Better checks for linking
with -lws2_32 when needed.  Use ASCII only isprint() when printing
X.509 certificate information, to avoid non-ASCII but printable
characters.  Thanks to Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> for
reports.

** Update internal copy of libtasn1 to version 1.4.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.6 (released 2008-04-17)

** Make gnutls_x509_crq_sign2 set certificate request version if not set.
** Improve documentation for gnutls_x509_crq_sign2.
Based on report from "John Brooks" <aspecialj@gmail.com> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1154>.

** tests/pathlen: run diff without parameters to improve portability.
Based on HPUX build hints in
<http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/hppd/cgi-bin/wwwtar?/hpux/Gnu/gnutls-2.3.4/gnutls-2.3.4-src-11.11.tar.gz+gnutls-2.3.4/HPUX.Install+text>.

** Don't use %e specifier with strftime, it doesn't work under Windows.
Reported by Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1170>.

** Remove all uses of gnutls_alloca/gnutls_afree.
Use normal gnutls_malloc instead.  One reason is increased portability
to Windows, the other is that several of the uses may be unsafe
because the size of data allocated could be large.  Reported by
Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1170>.

** Build Guile code with -fgnu89-inline only when supported.
Reported by Kris Karas <ktk@enterprise.bidmc.harvard.edu> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2708>.

** Several GTK-DOC related fixes.

** Clean up OpenCDK related code.
GnuTLS now requires its internal OpenCDK code rather than the external
GPL library OpenCDK.  Unfortunately, we don't have resources to
maintain an external library (help welcome).

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.5 (released 2008-04-14)

** Build fix for MinGW and --disable-shared.
Reported by Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1145>.

** Document how to generate CRLs.
Suggested by "Rainer Gerhards" <rgerhards@gmail.com>.

** Documented the --priority option to gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.

** Several minor fixes in the OpenPGP interface.
Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor.

** Fix fopen file descriptor leak in PSK server code.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-04/msg00002.html>.

** Translations files not stored directly in git to avoid merge conflicts.

** New APIs to let applications replace the RNG used.
Update all RNG callers in the code to use the new interface.

** Guile code now built with -fgnu89-inline to fix inline semantic problem.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_crypto_rnd_register: ADDED
gnutls_rnd_level_t: ADDED
GNUTLS_RND_KEY: ADDED, gnutls_rnd_level_t member
GNUTLS_RND_RANDOM: ADDED, gnutls_rnd_level_t member
GNUTLS_RND_NONCE: ADDED, gnutls_rnd_level_t member
gnutls_crypto_rnd_st: ADDED
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA224: ADDED
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA224: ADDED
gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_auth_subkey: MODIFIED

* Version 2.3.4 (released 2008-03-19)

** Finish renaming of gnutls_certificate_export_x509_cas etc.
They weren't renamed in the public header file.

** Added functions to register a cipher/mac/digest. This allows to 
override the included ones.

** Fix a bunch of compiler warnings.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_crypto_cipher_st: ADDED
gnutls_crypto_mac_st: ADDED
gnutls_crypto_digest_st: ADDED

gnutls_crypto_mac_register: ADDED
gnutls_crypto_digest_register: ADDED
GNUTLS_E_CRYPTO_ALREADY_REGISTERED: ADDED

* Version 2.3.3 (released 2008-03-10)

** Fix build failure in libextra/gnutls_extra.c that needed opencdk.h.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org>.

** No longer compiled using -D_REENTRANT -D_THREAD_SAFE.
We could not find any modern justification for enabling these flags by
default.  If you know of some platform that needs one of the flags to
work properly, please let us know.  (Actually introduced in v2.3.0 but
not documented until now.)

** Importing many CA certificates are now considerably faster.
This affect gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_mem,
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust, and
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file.  The complexity was reduced
from O(2*n^2) to O(n).  When adding 206 files containing 408
certificates, using gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file, the time
dropped from 40 seconds to 0.3 seconds.  Thanks to Edgar Fuß for code
to trigger the problem.  See also
<http://blog.josefsson.org/2008/02/27/real-world-performance-tuning-with-callgrind/>.

** Clarify documentation for gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alternative_name

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_hex2bin: MODIFIED, uses size_t instead of int for string length,
		and char* instead of void* for output buffer.

** Fix srcdir!=objdir failure in openpgpself test.

** Improved API documentation output from GTK-DOC.

** Added gnutls_x509_dn_export(). Patch by Joe Orton.

** Renamed gnutls_certificate_export_x509_cas and friends.
See <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-02/msg00043.html>.

** Internal header files cleanup.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_certificate_export_x509_cas: RENAMED to gnutls_certificate_get_x509_cas

** OpenPGP support merged into libgnutls and is now licensed under LGPL.
The included copy of OpenCDK has been stripped down and re-licensed
under the LGPL.

** Cipher priority string handling now handle strings that starts with NULL.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>.

** gnutls-cli: When -d is used, also prints RNG information from libgcrypt.

** Corrected memory leaks in session resuming and DHE ciphersuites. Reported
by Daniel Stenberg.

** Increased the default certificate verification chain limits and allowed
for checks without limitation.

** Corrected the behaviour of gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()
and gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name() to not null terminate binary
strings and return the proper size.

** Add section 'On Record Padding' to the manual.
This collects all problems related to record padding with
Nokia/Sony-Ericsson phones that we know about.

** Several improvements in the OpenPGP authentication.
Now subkeys can be used for authentication, according to
draft-mavrogiannopoulos-rfc5081bis-00.txt.

** certtool can print information on OpenPGP certificates and keys.

** Added gnutls_x509_dn_import/init/deinit() to access raw DER DN.
Patch by Joe Orton.

** Added gnutls_certificate_export_x509_cas and other functions to
export elements from the certificate credentials structure.  Based on
suggestion from Joe Orton.

** Doc fixes.
Clarify that srp_base64 is not the same as normal base64.

** Fix non-portable use of brace expansion in makefiles.

** API and ABI modifications:

                                old GNUTLS_X509_CRT_UNSIGNED_FULL.

* Version 2.3.0 (released 2008-01-08)

** LZO compression is now disabled by default.
The reason is that LZO compression is not standardized in TLS.  If you
wish to experiment with it, you will have to supply --with-lzo when
invoking ./configure.  The internal copy of minilzo is no longer
included with GnuTLS, so you will need to install liblzo or liblzo2 on
your system to have --with-lzo to be effective.

** More than one server name field is now sent to the server properly.
Thanks to mark.phillips@virgin.net.

** Fixes the post_client_hello_function(). The extensions are now parsed
in a callback friendly way.

** Fix for certificate selection in servers with certificate callbacks.

** Updated translations.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.5 (released 2008-05-19)

** Fix flaw in fix for GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3.
The flaw would result in incorrectly terminated sessions with the
error "Decryption has failed" when the server sends a small packet
(typically when the session is closed).  Reported by Andreas Metzler
<ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2807>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.4 (released 2008-05-19)

** Fix three security vulnerabilities.  [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
Thanks to CERT-FI for finding the bugs and providing detailed reports,
which allowed the bugs to be reproduced and fixed easily.  Patches
developed by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.  Any updates
with more details about these vulnerabilities will be added to
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.3 (released 2008-05-06)

** Increase default handshake packet size limit to 48kb.
The old limit was 16kb and some servers send huge list of trusted CAs,
thus running into the limit.  FYI, applications can further increase
this limit using gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length.  Thanks to
Marc Haber <mh+debian-bugs@zugschlus.de> and "Marc F. Clemente"
<marc@mclemente.net> for reporting and providing test servers.

** Fix compilation error related to __FUNCTION__ on some systems.
Reported by Tim Mooney, see
<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106267>.

** Documented the --priority option to gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.

** Fix fopen file descriptor leak in PSK server code.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-04/msg00002.html>.

** Build Guile code with -fgnu89-inline only when supported.
Reported by Kris Karas <ktk@enterprise.bidmc.harvard.edu> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2708>.

** Make Camellia encryption work.
Reported by Yoshisato YANAGISAWA <yanagisawa@csg.is.titech.ac.jp> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2746>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.2 (released 2008-02-21)

** Cipher priority string handling now handle strings that starts with NULL.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>.

** Corrected memory leaks in session resuming and DHE ciphersuites. Reported
by Daniel Stenberg.

** Increased the default certificate verification chain limits and allowed
for checks without limitation.

** Corrected the behaviour of gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()
and gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name() to not null terminate binary
strings and return the proper size.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.1 (released 2008-01-17)

** Prevent linking libextra against previously installed libgnutls.
Tiny patch from "Alon Bar-Lev" <alon.barlev@gmail.com>, see
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202269>.

** Fixes the post_client_hello_function(). The extensions are now parsed
in a callback friendly way.

** Fix for certificate selection in servers with certificate callbacks.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.0 (released 2007-12-14)

** Update internal copy of libtasn1 to version 1.2.

** Certtool --verify-chain now handle inputs larger than 64kb.
This fixes the self-test "rsa-md5-collision" under MinGW+Wine with
recent versions of libgcrypt.  The problem was that Wine with the
libgcrypt RNG generates huge amounts of debugging output.

** Translation updates.
Added Dutch translation.  Updated Polish and Swedish translation.

** Major changes compared to the v2.0 branch:

*** SRP support aligned with newly published RFC 5054.

*** OpenPGP support aligned with newly published RFC 5081.

*** Support for DSA2 keys.

*** Support for Camellia cipher.

*** Support for Opaque PRF Input extension.

*** PKCS#8 parser now handle DSA keys.

*** Change from GPLv2 to GPLv3 for command-line tools, libgnutls-extra, etc.
Notice that liblzo2 2.02 is licensed under GPLv2 only.  Earlier
versions, such as 2.01 which is included with GnuTLS, is available
under GPLv2 or later.  If this incompatibility causes problems, we
recommend you to disable LZO using --without-lzo.  LZO compression is
not a standard TLS compression algorithm, so the impact should be
minimal.

*** Functions for disabling record protocol padding.
Works around bugs on Nokia/Ericsson phones.

*** New functions gnutls_priority_set() for setting cipher priorities easily.
Priorities like "COMPAT" also enables other work arounds, such as
disabling padding.

*** Other minor improvements and bug fixes.

** Backwards incompatible API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.2
To adapt to changes in the TLS extension specifications for OpenPGP
and SRP, the GnuTLS API had to be modified.  This means breaking the
API and ABI backwards compatibility.  That is something we try to
avoid unless it is necessary.  We decided to also remove the already
deprecated stub functions for X.509 to XML conversion and TLS
authorization (see below) when we had the opportunity.

Generally, most applications does not need to be modified.  Just
re-compile them against the latest GnuTLS release, and it should work
fine.

Applications that use the OpenPGP or SRP features needs to be
modified.  Below is a list of the modified APIs and discussion of what
the minimal things you need to modify in your application to make it
work with GnuTLS 2.2.

Note that GnuTLS 2.2 also introduces new APIs -- such as
gnutls_set_priority() that is superior to
gnutls_set_default_priority() -- that you may want to start using.
However, using those new APIs is not required to use GnuTLS 2.2 since
the old functions continue are still supported.  This text only
discuss what you minimally have to modify.

*** XML related changes
The function `gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml' has been removed.  It has been
deprecated and only returned an error code since GnuTLS version
1.2.11.  Nobody has complained, so users doesn't seem to miss the
functionality.  We don't know of any other library to convert X.509
certificates into XML format, but we decided (long ago) that GnuTLS
isn't the right place for this kind of functionality.  If you want
help to find some other library to use here, please explain and
discuss your use case on help-gnutls@gnu.org.

*** TLS Authorization related changes
Everything related to TLS authorizations have been removed, they were
only stub functions that returned an error code:

 GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_AUTHZ_DATA
 gnutls_authz_data_format_type_t
 gnutls_authz_recv_callback_func
 gnutls_authz_send_callback_func
 gnutls_authz_enable
 gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert
 gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion
 gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert_url
 gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion_url

*** SRP related changes
The callback gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function has a new
prototype, and its semantic has changed.  You need to rewrite the
callback, see the updated function documentation and SRP example code
(doc/examples/ex-client-srp.c and doc/examples/ex-serv-srp.c) for more
information.

The alert codes GNUTLS_A_MISSING_SRP_USERNAME and
GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_SRP_USERNAME are no longer used by the SRP
specification, instead the GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_PSK_IDENTITY alert is
used.  There are #define's to map the old names to the new.  You may
run into problems if you have a switch-case with cases for both SRP
alerts, since they are now mapped to the same value.  The solution is
to drop the SRP alerts from such switch cases, as they are now
deprecated in favor of GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_PSK_IDENTITY.

*** OpenPGP related changes
The function `gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyserver' have been
removed.  There is no replacement functionality inside GnuTLS.  If you
need keyserver functionality, consider using the GnuPG tools.

All functions, types, and error codes related to OpenPGP trustdb
format have been removed.  The trustdb format is a non-standard
GnuPG-specific format, and we recommend you to use key rings instead.
The following have been removed:

 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_trustdb
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_init
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_deinit
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_import
 gnutls_openpgp_key_verify_trustdb
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_t
 GNUTLS_E_OPENPGP_TRUSTDB_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED

The following functions has an added parameter of the (new) type
`gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t'.  The type specify the format of the data
(binary or base64).  The functions are:
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_mem
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_mem
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file

To improve terminology and align with the X.509 interface, some
functions have been renamed.  Compatibility mappings exists.  The old
and new names of the affected functions and types are:

        Old name                                New name
 gnutls_openpgp_key_t                    gnutls_openpgp_crt_t
 gnutls_openpgp_key_fmt_t                gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t
 gnutls_openpgp_key_status_t             gnutls_openpgp_crt_status_t
 GNUTLS_OPENPGP_KEY                      GNUTLS_OPENPGP_CERT
 GNUTLS_OPENPGP_KEY_FINGERPRINT          GNUTLS_OPENPGP_CERT_FINGERPRINT
 gnutls_openpgp_key_init                 gnutls_openpgp_crt_init

 gnutls_openpgp_key_import               gnutls_openpgp_crt_import
 gnutls_openpgp_key_export               gnutls_openpgp_crt_export
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_key_usage        gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_key_usage
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_fingerprint      gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_fingerprint
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_pk_algorithm     gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_pk_algorithm
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_name             gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_name
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_version          gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_version
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_creation_time    gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_creation_time
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_expiration_time  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_expiration_time
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_id               gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_id
 gnutls_openpgp_key_check_hostname       gnutls_openpgp_crt_check_hostname
 gnutls_openpgp_send_key                 gnutls_openpgp_send_cert

** API and ABI modifications:

* Version 2.1.8 (released 2007-12-10)

** The GPL version has been changed from version 2 to version 3.
This affects the self-tests, command-line tools, the libgnutls-extra
library, the relevant guile parts, and the build environment.

** Added gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name2().

** Corrected a segfault when setting an empty gnutls_priority_t
at gnutls_priority_set().

** Use gettext 0.17 which updates m4/lib-*.m4 macros.
Fixes a problem with spurious -L/usr/lib additions.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name2: ADD.

* Version 2.1.7 (released 2007-11-29)

accept a string to indicate preferences of ciphersuite parameters.

** gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv now have a --priority option to set
the priority string.

** The gnutls_*_convert_priority() functions were deprecated by
the gnutls_priority_set() and gnutls_priority_set_direct().

** Internal copy of OpenCDK upgraded to version 0.6.6.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_priority_init: ADD.
gnutls_priority_deinit: ADD.
gnutls_priority_set: ADD.
gnutls_priority_set_direct: ADD.

* Version 2.1.6 (released 2007-11-15)

** Corrected bug in decompression of expanded compression data.

** Added the --to-p8 option to certtool to convert private keys
to PKCS #8 keys.

** Introduced the GNUTLS_E_BASE64_UNEXPECTED_HEADER_ERROR error code.

** gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_* can now read PKCS #8 unencrypted
private keys.

** Fixed GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM vs GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM.
During the 2.1.x series the GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM error code
was renamed to GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM, unfortunately without being
documented.  This caused some problems (e.g., debian #450854).  To
avoid backwards compatibility problems, this release revert this
change, so that GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM works just like it has
done in GnuTLS 2.0.x and earlier, and add a new error code
GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM.

** Fixes several gtk-doc warnings.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM: CHANGED.
GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM: CHANGED.

** Added the --v1 option to certtool, to allow generating X.509
version 1 certificates. 

** certtool: Add option --disable-quick-random to enable the old behaviour
of using /dev/random to generate keys.

** Added priority functions that accept strings.

** Added gnutls_set_default_priority2() which accepts a flag to indicate
priorities preferences.

** Added gnutls_record_disable_padding() to allow servers talking to 
buggy clients that complain if the TLS 1.0 record protocol padding is
used.

** Introduced gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode() to allow enabling
all supported compatibility options (like disabling padding).

** The gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_* functions were modified to include
the format. This makes the interface consistent with the x509 functions.

** Internal copy of OpenCDK upgraded to version 0.6.5.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 2.1.3 (released 2007-10-17)

** TLS authorization support removed.
This technique may be patented in the future, and it is not of crucial
importance for the Internet community.  After deliberation we have
concluded that the best thing we can do in this situation is to
encourage society not to adopt this technique.  We have decided to
lead the way with our own actions.

** Re-enabled the 256 bit ciphers in the default priorities.

** Corrected bugs in openpgp key verification using a keyring (both in
gnutls and opencdk)

** Removed all the trustdb code from openpgp authentication.
We now use only the well-specified keyrings.

** The 256 bit ciphers are not enabled in the default priorities.

** Added support for DSA2 using libgcrypt 1.3.0.

** certtool: Fixed data corruption when using --outder.

** Removed all the xml related stubs and functions.

** Added capability to set a callback after the client hello is received
by the server in order to adjust parameters before the handshake.

** SRP was corrected to adhere to the latest draft (published soon as RFC)

** Corrected bug which did not allow a server to run without supporting
certificates.

** Updated the DN parser which now prints wrongly decoded values as hex
strings.

** certtool: Add option --quick-random.
For generating low security test credentials.

* Version 2.1.1 (released 2007-09-24)

** Added support for Camellia cipher, thanks to Yoshisato YANAGISAWA.
Camellia is only enabled in GnuTLS if the installed libgcrypt has been
compiled with Camellia support.  See the libgcrypt documentation on
how to enable it.  Unconditionally disable it using the configure
option --disable-camellia.  Fixes #1.

** Properly document in the NEWS file the API change in the last release.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.1.0 (released 2007-09-20)

** Support for draft-rescorla-tls-opaque-prf-input-00.txt.
The support is disabled by default.  Since no value has been allocated
by the IANA for this extension yet, you will need to provide one
yourself by invoking './configure --enable-opaque-prf-input=42'.
Fixes #2.

** Example code: Fix compilation flaw under MinGW.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_oprfi_callback_func: ADD, new typedef function prototype.
gnutls_oprfi_enable_client: ADD, new function.
gnutls_oprfi_enable_server: ADD, new function.

No changes since last version.

* Version 2.0.3 (released 2007-11-10)

** This version backports several fixes from the 2.1.x branch.

** Fixed PKCS #3 parameter export.

** Added gnutls_record_disable_padding() to allow servers talking to
buggy clients that complain if the TLS 1.0 record protocol padding is
used.

** Introduced gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode() to allow enabling
all supported compatibility options (like disabling padding).

** Corrected bug which did not allow a server to run without supporting
certificates.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode: ADDED

** TLS authorization support removed.
This technique may be patented in the future, and it is not of crucial
importance for the Internet community.  After deliberation we have
concluded that the best thing we can do in this situation is to
encourage society not to adopt this technique.  We have decided to
lead the way with our own actions.

** certtool: Fixed data corruption when using --outder.

** Fix configure-time Guile detection.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_USER_MAPPING_DATA: ADDED.  To avoid that the
    gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t enum type becomes empty.

* Version 2.0.1 (released 2007-09-20)

** New directory doc/credentials/ with test credentials.
This collects the test credentials from the web page and from src/.
The script gnutls-http-serv has also been moved to that directory.

** Update SRP extension type and cipher suite with official IANA values.
This breaks backwards compatibility with SRP in older versions of
GnuTLS, but this is intentional to speed up the adoption of the
official values.  The old values we used were incorrect.

** Guile: Fix `x509-certificate-dn-oid'

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.0.0 (released 2007-09-04)

** Included copy of Libtasn1 upgraded to version 1.1.

** Disable building of some examples if anonymous ciphers are disabled.

** Don't build examples for disabled features.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.19 (released 2007-08-27)

** Fix gnutls_error_is_fatal so that positive "errors" are non-critical.
This solves connection problems in mutt, see
<http://bugs.debian.org/439640>.

** Update gnulib files.
In particular, the getpass module -- with its dependencies on getline,
getdelim, fseeko etc -- where moved from the lgl/ (used by the core
library) directory to the gl/ directory (only used by the command line
tools).  The reason is that getpass is now only used by the
command-line tools, and reducing the number of gnulib modules linked
to the core library helps portability and reduces size.

** Fix warnings.

** Disable building of PGP examples if PGP is disabled.

** Included copy of OpenCDK upgraded to version 0.6.4.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.18 (released 2007-08-16)

** Install images for the info manual.
This has a side effect of renaming the images.  See
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.texinfo.bugs/3533> for
discussions on the approach chosen.

** Fix pointer mix to variables of different size.
Patch extracted from
<http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/devel/gnutls/gnutls-1.6.3-incompat-pointers.patch?rev=1.1&view=auto>.

** Fix warnings during build.
Thanks to Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.17 (released 2007-08-15)

** New functions to perform external signing.
Set the signing callback function (of the gnutls_sign_func prototype)
using the gnutls_sign_callback_set function.  In the callback, you may
find the new functions gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_hash and
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_sign_hash useful.  A new function
gnutls_sign_callback_get is also added, to retrieve the function
pointer.  Thanks to "Alon Bar-Lev" <alon.barlev@gmail.com> for
comments and testing.

** New self test of client and server authenticated X.509 TLS sessions.
See tests/x509self.c and tests/x509signself.c.  The latter also tests
the new external signing callback interface.

** New errors GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MIN..GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MAX.
These two actually describe the outer limits of a range of error codes
reserved to the application.  All of the errors are treated as fatal
by the library (it has to since it doesn't know the semantics of the
error codes).  This can be useful in callbacks, to signal some
application-specific error condition, which will usually eventually
cause some gnutls API to return the same error code as the callback,
which then can be inspected by the application.  Note that error codes
are negative.

** gnutls_set_default_priority now disable TLS 1.2 by default.
The RFC is not released yet, and we're approaching a major release so
let's not enable it just yet.

** Fix namespace so that gnutls_*_t is used consistently.
Before, many places in the GnuTLS code used the old deprecated type
names without the '_t' suffix.

** Build fixes for Guile code.
Patch from Ludovic Courtes <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** More documentation fixes.
In particular, the section headings were modified for casing.  By
Ludovic Courtes <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Updated Polish and Swedish translations.
Thanks to Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org> and Daniel Nylander
<po@danielnylander.se>.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_sign_func: ADD, new type for sign callback.
gnutls_sign_callback_set: ADD, new function to set sign callback.
gnutls_sign_callback_get: ADD, new function to retrieve sign callback.
gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_hash,
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_sign_hash: ADD, new functions useful in sign callback.
GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MIN,
GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MAX: ADD, new CPP #defines for error codes.

* Version 1.7.16 (released 2007-08-07)

** Fix sanity checks and return values in certificate selection.
In some cases, GnuTLS omitted to report suitable error codes when no
suitable certificate was found.

** Fix gnutls-cli starttls EOF on Mac OS X.
Thanks to Hal Eden <n.mavrogiannopoulos@gmail.com>.

** Documentation fixes.
In particular, the section headings were modified for casing.  By

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.15 (released 2007-07-02)

** Fix self-tests key-id under mingw32.

** Test that the Guile header files are recent enough to work.
Before we just tested that the command line tool 'guile' was recent
enough, which may not be sufficient if you still have an old
libguile.h header installed.

** Guile bindings are now installed under $prefix by default.
Use --without-guile-site-dir to install it under $pkgdatadir/site/
where $pkgdatadir is as returned by "guile-config info pkgdatadir".
Use --with-guile-site-dir=/your/own/path to specify the path manually.
The default, --with-guile-site-dir, will install the Guile bindings
under $datadir/guile/site.  There is a new section 'Guile
Preparations' in the manual that discuss these issues.

** Fix run-time library path ordering in linking the Guile bindings.

** Improved manual on downloading, installing, getting help, bug reports etc.
Suggested by Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Add Malay message translations.
Thanks to Sharuzzaman Ahmat Raslan <sharuzzaman@myrealbox.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:

Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.10 (released 2007-05-25)

** New API functions to extract DER encoded X.509 Subject/Issuer DN.
Suggested by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** GnuTLS is now developed in GIT instead of CVS.
See <http://repo.or.cz/w/gnutls.git> for a public repository.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_issuer_dn: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_dn: ADD.

* Version 1.7.9 (released 2007-05-12)

** X.509 certificates are preferred over OpenPGP keys.
This is a change in the semantics of gnutls_set_default_priority.

** The included copy of OpenCDK has been updated to 0.6.1.
There has been some API changes in OpenCDK, and the GnuTLS layer have
been modified as well.  Note that while there are API/ABI incompatible
changes in OpenCDK, this does not influence GnuTLS's API/ABI because
its API/ABI have not changed.  From this version on, GnuTLS requires
OpenCDK 0.6.0 or later.

** Fix build failure caused by missing doc/gnutls-logo.pdf.

** Change certtool's default serial number from 0 to a time-based value.

** Fix X.509 signing with RSA-PKCS#1 to set a NULL parameters fields.
Before, we remove the parameters field, which resulted in a slightly
different DER encoding which in turn caused signature verification
failures of GnuTLS-generated RSA certificates in some other
implementations (e.g., GnuPG 2.x's gpgsm).  Depending on which RFCs
you read, this may or may not be correct, but our new behaviour appear
to be consistent with other widely used implementations.

** Fix mem leaks in gnutls_x509_crt_print.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.8 (released 2007-04-16)

** Added examples for the authorization extension.
See doc/examples/ex-client-authz.c and doc/examples/ex-serv-authz.c.

** The examples only use gnutls_set_default_priority().
The exception is when DH_ANON is needed.

** Improve gnutls_set_default_priority() priorities.
The new approach is for it to try and negotiate all secure and
standard mechanisms available.  Currently, DH_ANON ciphersuites and
LZO compressions are not enabled by default, because they are,
respectively, insecure and non-standardized.  Note that TLS 1.2 will
not be enabled by default in non-experimental release until it has
been approved by the IETF.

** gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv now uses the library's default priorities.
This means that to get DH_ANON and LZO compression, you'll need to
specify that manually using '--kx anon' or '--comp lzo'.

** Minor fixes to the human display format of X.509 certificates.

** New APIs to extract Distinguished Name's from X.509 certificates.
Based on patch from Howard Chu <hyc@symas.com>.

** Improved library searching for opencdk.
It will now add the appropriate -R or -Wl,-rpath flags as necessary.
The deprecated opencdk.m4 is no longer used.

** New APIs to list supported algorithms in the library.
The APIs are gnutls_cipher_list, gnutls_mac_list,
gnutls_compression_list, gnutls_protocol_list,
gnutls_certificate_type_list, gnutls_kx_list, and
gnutls_cipher_suite_info.  Suggested by Howard Chu <hyc@symas.com>.

** The gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id API now handle non-RSA/DSA keys.

** New configure option --disable-tls-authorization to disable tls-authz.

** Fix prototype for `gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials'.
The last parameter was renamed from 'flags' to 'format' and the type
changed from 'unsigned int' to 'gnutls_psk_key_flags' (an enum type),
which shouldn't cause any ABI changes.  Reported by ludo@chbouib.org
(Ludovic Courtès).

** Fix allocation in gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key.
Tiny patch from ludo@chbouib.org (Ludovic Courtès).

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_dn_t: ADD.
gnutls_x509_ava_st: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject,
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer: ADD.
gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava: ADD.
gnutls_cipher_list: ADD.
gnutls_mac_list: ADD.
gnutls_compression_list: ADD.
gnutls_protocol_list: ADD.
gnutls_certificate_type_list: ADD.
gnutls_kx_list: ADD.
gnutls_cipher_suite_info: ADD.

* Version 1.7.7 (released 2007-02-22)

** Support for supplemental handshake messages and authorization data.
Supplemental data is described in RFC 4680 and the authorization
extensions in draft-housley-tls-authz-extns-07.

** Support for authorization data in gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.
New parameters --authz-x509-attr-cert and --authz-saml-assertion.

** Fix for gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname.
Before it would have reported that the certificate matched a hostname
when it did not have any dNSName or any CN field.  Report and tiny
patch from "Richard W.M. Jones" <rjones@redhat.com>.

** New self test for RFC 2818 comparison in gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname.
Tests regressions of the bug, and several other features.

** GnuTLS now matches URI's with IP Addresses against iPAddress SAN's.
Before there were no support for iPAddress SAN's during comparison.

** New API to print information about CRL's.
The function is gnutls_x509_crl_print.

** New API to extract signature value from CRL's.
The function is gnutls_x509_crl_get_signature.

** Support for directoryName Subject Alternative Name's.
The gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name function returns the DN as a
string in the provided buffer.

** Internal improvements to certtool.
It uses gnutls_x509_crl_print to print CRL information.  It uses some
more gnulib modules to simplify error handling.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_SUPPLEMENTAL: ADD, new gnutls_handshake_description_t element.
gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t: ADD.
gnutls_authz_data_format_type_t: ADD.
gnutls_supplemental_get_name: ADD.
gnutls_authz_recv_callback_func,
gnutls_authz_send_callback_func: ADD, callback prototypes.
gnutls_authz_enable: ADD.
gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert,
gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion,
gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert_url,
gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion_url: ADD.
GNUTLS_SAN_DN: ADD, new gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t element.
gnutls_x509_crl_print: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crl_get_signature: ADD.

* Version 1.7.6 (released 2007-02-12)

** Support for 'otherName' Subject Alternative Names.
The existing API gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name may now return
the new type GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME together with the otherName value.
To find out the otherName OID (necessary for proper parsing of the
value), use the new API gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid.
For known OIDs, gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid will
return "virtual" SAN values, e.g., GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP to
simplify OID matching.  Suggested by Matthias Wimmer <m@tthias.eu>.

** Certtool can print otherName SAN values for certificates.
For known otherName OIDs (currently only id-on-xmppAddr as defined by
RFC 3920), it will also print the name.

** Fix TLS 1.2 RSA signing in servers.
Before it used the old-style MD5+SHA1 signature, but the TLS
signatures should be normal PKCS#1 signatures.  FYI, we use and
require that DigestInfo parameters are present and NULL for TLS 1.2.

** Add APIs to access X.509 extensions sequentially.
The existing APIs gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_oid() and
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid() does not permit callers to
inspect the extensions in the order defined by the certificate.

** Add API to extract signature value from X.509 certificates.
The function is gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature.

** Fix crash when generating proxy certificates in batch mode.
If you don't specify a proxy policy in batch mode, it will use
id-ppl-inheritALL.

** Add API to print information about X.509 certificates.
The function is gnutls_x509_crt_print.

** Certtool uses the new API gnutls_x509_crt_print to print certificate info.
One consequence of this is that the output syntax has changed
slightly.  Some more fields are printed.

** Doc fixes.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_print: ADD
gnutls_certificate_print_formats_t: ADD, new enum.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid: ADD.
GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME: ADD, new gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t element.
GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP: ADD, new gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t element.

* Version 1.7.5 (released 2007-02-06)

** Servers won't negotiate SRP RSA/DSS cipher suites if no SRP credential
** is set.

** Default behaviour for the gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv tools improved.

** Fix --list output for gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.
Mention TLS1.2, SHA512 etc.

** Manual contains new section on setting up a test HTTP server.
A server set up following those descriptions are available online via
<http://www.gnutls.org/server.html>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.4 (released 2007-02-05)

** Support for RSA signing using SHA-256/384/512.
A new self test "sha2" tries to build a long X.509 certificate chain
testing all new hashes.

** The gnutls-serv tool now use static DH parameters if none are supplied.

** Discuss proxy certificates in the manual.

** Improve bibliographical citations in the manual.

** Update of gnulib files.

** Fix certtool template handling of pathLenConstraints.
It now defaults to -1 instead of 0, which causes the field to be
missing unless the template specify it.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_MAC_SHA256,
GNUTLS_MAC_SHA384,
GNUTLS_MAC_SHA512: New gnutls_mac_algorithm_t values.
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256,
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA384,
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA512: New gnutls_digest_algorithm_t values.
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA256,
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA384,
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA512: New gnutls_sign_algorithm_t values.

* Version 1.7.3 (released 2007-02-01)

** New option to certtool: --generate-proxy.
This will generate a Proxy Certificate from an end entity certificate.
Proxy Certificates are documented in RFC 3820.  You will need to
specify the proxy certificate's private key with --load-privkey, the
user certificate with --load-certificate and the private key used to
sign the new proxy certificate with --load-ca-privkey.  Certtool will
query for proxy path length and the policy language OID.  Currently
only OIDs that have an empty policy are supported (which includes the
two OIDs defined by RFC 3820).

** Certtool --certificate-info now prints information for Proxy Certificates.
Before the proxy extension was just printed as DER encoded data.

** New APIs to set proxy subject names and get/set proxy cert extension.

** Fix parsing of pathLenConstraints in BasicConstraints with missing cA.

** Added self-test to test for regressions of pathLenConstraint bug.
Incidentally, this also test (some) other regressions or changes in
the output from certtool --certificate-info.

** When certtool generates CA certificates, pressing enter on the path
** length constraint query will now remove the field.
Before it set the path length constraint to 0, which is a rather poor
default.

** Certtool now print times in UTC when printing certificate/CRL info.

** Add better fix to work around C++ compiler bug on Mac OS X.
Reported and tiny patch provided by Matthias Scheler <tron@NetBSD.org>.

** Fix import of ASCII armored OpenPGP keys.
Patch by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy_dn: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_proxy: ADD.

* Version 1.7.2 (released 2007-01-14)

** Certtool now print the value of the pathLenConstraints field for certs.

** Certtool now query for path length constraints when generating CA certs.
For batch uses, the certtool configuration name is "path_len".
Suggested by Sascha Ziemann <sascha.ziemann@secunet.com>.

** Add new API to get/set pathLenConstraint in the Basic Constraints.
The new functions gnutls_x509_crt_get_basic_constraints and
gnutls_x509_crt_set_basic_constraints provide a superset of the
functionality in the old gnutls_x509_crt_get_ca_status and
gnutls_x509_crt_set_ca_status (respectively), but the old functions
will continue to be supported.

** Add new API in OpenCDK to extract public/secret OpenPGP key to S-expr.
The functions are cdk_pubkey_to_sexp and cdk_seckey_to_sexp.  A proper
OpenCDK release with this patch will be made soon, which should bump
the OpenCDK version number.  Patch by Mario Lenz <mario.lenz@gmx.net>.

** Certtool --to-p12 can now store more than one certificate in the blob.
Before it could only store one certificate, but now it will read and
store as many certificate there are from the --load-certificate file.
Suggested by Sascha Ziemann <sascha.ziemann@secunet.com>.

** Clean up separation of gnutls and gnutls-extra for OpenPGP.
In particular, the OpenPGP function variables are no longer part of
the exported libgnutls interface, and no header files from
libgnutls-extra (GPL) are needed by libgnutls (LGPL).  The variables
were never intended for non-internal purposes, and thus this does not
imply a change in the external API/ABI.

** Print URL to gaa when missing, and fix srcdir!=builddir for GAA files.
Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** GnuTLS no longer uses -mms-bitfields --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc.
Before these parameters were set to make GnuTLS build under mingw32,
however, they appear to no longer be necessary.

** A minor fix to the C++ library to make it build.
Reported by Pavlov Konstantin <thresh@altlinux.ru>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_basic_constraints: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_set_basic_constraints: ADD.
cdk_pubkey_to_sexp: ADD (in opencdk).
cdk_seckey_to_sexp: ADD (in opencdk).

* Version 1.7.1 (released 2006-12-28)

** TLS 1.2 server side fix.
The Certificate Request sent did not contain the list of supported
hashes field, thus violating the protocol.  It will now contain an
empty list.  Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** TLS 1.2 DSA signature verification fix.
Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** Fix the list of trusted CAs that server's send to clients.
Before, the list contained issuer DN's instead of subject DN's of the
trusted CAs.  Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Fix gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl to initialize the CRL before using it.
Also added a self-test in tests/certificate_set_x509_crl.c to test the
function.  Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Encode UID fields in DN's as DirectoryString.
Before GnuTLS encoded and parsed UID fields as IA5String.  This was
incorrect, it should have used DirectoryString.  Now it will use
DirectoryString for the UID field, but for backwards compatibility it
will also accept IA5String UID's.  Reported by Max Kellermann
<max@duempel.org>.

** Improve out-of-sourcedir builds from CVS.
Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** Bootstrap tools changed.
We now require autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10, and gettext 0.16, when
building GnuTLS from CVS.  Libtool 1.5.22 is used.

** Fixed a syntax error in lib/gnutls.asn.
Reported by Paul Millar <p.millar@physics.gla.ac.uk>.

** Added German translation of GnuTLS messages.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.0 (released 2006-11-29)

** The default protocol priority try TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 too.
The details is that the protocol priority set by
`gnutls_set_default_priority' has been changed from TLS 1.0 and SSL
3.0 to TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0.

** Preliminary support for TLS 1.2.
The client has been successfully tested against
https://www.mikestoolbox.org:4433/.

** Anonself test now print a lot of debugging info, including TLS version.

** Doc fixes in OpenCDK, to avoid some gtk-doc warnings.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_TLS1_2: New gnutls_protocol_t enum member.

*** Pulled up from stable 1.6.x branch:

** Fix ./configure failure with non-GCC compilers.
This fixes the following error message:
configure: error: conditional "HAVE_LD_OUTPUT_DEF" was never defined.
Reported by "Michael C. Vergallen" <mvergall@telenet.be>.

* Version 1.6.3 (released 2007-05-26)

** New API functions to extract DER encoded X.509 Subject/Issuer DN.
Suggested by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>.  Backported
from the 1.7.x branch, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnutls/2007-05/msg00029.html>.

** Have PKCS8 parser return better error codes.
Reported by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>, see
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-May/001653.html> and

** Fix mem leak for sessions with client authentication via certificates.
Reported by Andrew W. Nosenko <andrew.w.nosenko@gmail.com>, see
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-April/001539.html>.

** Fix building of 'tlsia' self test.
Earlier some gcc are known to build tlsia linking to
$prefix/lib/libgnutls-extra.so rather than the libgnutls-extra.so in
the build directory, even though command line parameters look OK.
Changing order of some parameters fixes it.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_issuer_dn: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_dn: ADD.

* Version 1.6.2 (released 2007-04-18)

** Fix X.509 signing with RSA-PKCS#1 to set a NULL parameters fields.
Before, we remove the parameters field, which resulted in a slightly
different DER encoding which in turn caused signature verification
failures of GnuTLS-generated RSA certificates in some other
implementations (e.g., GnuPG 2.x's gpgsm).  Depending on which RFCs
you read, this may or may not be correct, but our new behaviour appear
to be consistent with other widely used implementations.

** Regenerate the PKIX ASN.1 syntax tree.
For some reason, after changing the ASN.1 type of ldap-UID in the last
release, the generated C file built from the ASN.1 schema was not
refreshed.  This can cause problems when reading/writing UID
components inside X.500 Distinguished Names.  Reported by devel
<dev001@pas-world.com>.

** Updated translations.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.6.1 (released 2006-12-28)

** Fix the list of trusted CAs that server's send to clients.
Before, the list contained issuer DN's instead of subject DN's of the
trusted CAs.  Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Fix gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl to initialize the CRL before using it.
Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Encode UID fields in DN's as DirectoryString.
Before GnuTLS encoded and parsed UID fields as IA5String.  This was
incorrect, it should have used DirectoryString.  Now it will use
DirectoryString for the UID field, but for backwards compatibility it
will also accept IA5String UID's.  Reported by Max Kellermann
<max@duempel.org>.

** Fix ./configure failure with non-GCC compilers.
This fixes the following error message:
configure: error: conditional "HAVE_LD_OUTPUT_DEF" was never defined.
Reported by "Michael C. Vergallen" <mvergall@telenet.be>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.6.0 (released 2006-11-17)

** No changes since 1.5.5.
The major changes compared to the 1.4.x branch are:

*** A GnuTLS C++ library is part of the official distribution.
Currently there are no examples or documentation, but hopefully this
will change.  See gnutlsxx.h for the API.

*** Windows is a supported platform.
There are, however, two know bugs.  One is related to select() in
command line tools (not, nota bene, in the library), the other is a
problem with libgcrypt that causes delays.  Help is needed to resolve
those issues, so we feel we can't delay the release because of this.

*** New APIs for custom push/pull function error reporting.
The new APIs are gnutls_transport_set_errno and
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno.  See the release notes for version
1.5.4 for more information.

*** Self tests are run under valgrind, if available.  See --disable-valgrind.

* Version 1.5.5 (released 2006-11-16)

** Correctly bump shared library version after adding new APIs.
This was forgotten in the last release.

** Fix unsigned vs signed problem in ex-x509-info.c example.
Reported by Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.

** Fix the rsa-md5-collision self test to work for MinGW+Wine.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.4 (released 2006-11-07)

** New API functions to set errno in push/pull functions.
Under Windows, setting the errno variable in a push/pull replacement
may end up setting the wrong errno variable, and GnuTLS send/recv
functions become confused about the real errno returned from a failed
push/pull function.  Therefor, we have added two APIs to set the errno
variable used by GnuTLS.  The APIs can also help to keep things
thread-safe, by avoiding potentially global variables.  Typically,
instead of setting errno in your push/pull function, you will call one
of these functions.  It is recommended to use
gnutls_transport_set_errno, but if you don't have the session variable
easily accessible in the push/pull replacement function, you can use
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno.  Suggested by Tim Kosse
<tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.

void gnutls_transport_set_errno (gnutls_session_t session, int err);
void gnutls_transport_set_global_errno (int err);

** When calling `recv' or `send' Windows errors are handled properly.
The Windows recv/send functions doesn't use errno, and GnuTLS now use
WSAGetLastError to access the error condition instead.

** Several OpenPGP API fixes.
All suggested by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).  The most
important fix is to change the return value of
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_pk_algorithm and
gnutls_openpgp_key_get_pk_algorithm from 'int' to
'gnutls_pk_algorithm_t', which is an enum type (and thus API/ABI
compatible with 'int').

** When a GnuTLS server receive a SSLv2 Client Hello for an unknown TLS
** version, try to negotiate the highest version support by the GnuTLS server,
** instead of the lowest.
Reported by <Pasi.Eronen@nokia.com>.

** Replace old constructs with use of gnulib modules.
For example, we can now assume unistd.h, sys/stat.h, sys/socket.h in
the code.  If the headers doesn't exist on the target system, gnulib
will make sure its replacement header files are used instead.

** Fix SOVERSION computation for *.def files.
This fixes build errors similar to "No rule to make target
`libgnutls-`expr', needed by `all-am'." when building for Windows.

** gnutls_check-version uses strverscmp from gnulib.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_transport_set_errno: ADD
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno: ADD

* Version 1.5.3 (released 2006-10-26)

** Add new self-test of RSA-MD5 signature chains.
Note that we already, since GnuTLS 1.2.9, reject RSA-MD5 signatures
when verifying X.509 chains.  The code is in tests/rsa-md5-collision/
and is based on the work by Marc Stevens et al, see
<http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/>.

** Re-factor self tests.

** The include copy of Libtasn1 is updated to version 0.3.7.

** The included copy of OpenCDK is updated to version 0.5.11.

** Fix the filename of the *.def file on Windows after library version bump.

** Separated the gnulib directory into one for LGPL modules and one for GPL.
This allows the GPL'd part of GnuTLS to take advantage of the GPL'd
gnulib modules.  Earlier we could only use the LGPL'ed module from
gnulib, because two gnulib directories in the same project didn't
work.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.2 (released 2006-10-03)

** Decrement the shared library version back to 13 (as in the 1.4.x branch).
Note that if you installed 1.5.0 or 1.5.1, they will have a higher
shared library version than this version, so you'll have to remove
them and possibly relink your applications.  The reason for this is
that no API/ABI changes have been made since the 1.4.x branch, and
that incrementing the shared library version was a mistake.  Reported
by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Fix off-by-one error when computing length to malloc.
The code is used by gnutls_openpgp_add_keyring_file and
gnutls_openpgp_add_keyring_mem.  Reported by "Adam Langley"
<agl@imperialviolet.org>.

** Add version script for the GnuTLS C++ library.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Fix the C++ compiler detection logic.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.1 (released 2006-09-21)

** Fix PKCS#1 verification to avoid a variant of Bleichenbacher's
** Crypto 06 rump session attack.
In particular, we check that the digestAlgorithm.parameters field is
missing or empty, to avoid that it can contain "garbage" that may be
used to alter the numeric properties of the signature.  See
<http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg14307.html> (which is
not exactly the same as the problem we fix here).  Reported by Yutaka
OIWA <y.oiwa@aist.go.jp>.

See GNUTLS-SA-2006-4 on http://www.gnutls.org/security.html for more
up to date information.

** Add self test to test for above flaw.

** Fix gnutls-cli-debug regarding resume support detection.
Earlier, if the session-id from the server had a length of 0, it would
indicate that the server supports resumption, which isn't the case.
Reported by Kataja Kai <kai.kataja@op.fi>.

** Fix building of examples on FreeBSD by including netinet/in.h.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org>.

** Fix certtool bug that caused the private key to not be loaded when
generating a certificate with --load-request, which in turn triggered
another unrelated bug in gnutls_x509_crt_sign2 (also fixed).  Reported
by Sascha Ziemann <sascha.ziemann@secunet.com>.

** gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv works on Windows.
The problem was the select() call that doesn't work on file
descriptors (stdin) on Windows.  We borrowed some code from plibc to
solve this.  It appears to be somewhat unreliable though.

** Autoconf 2.60 is now used.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.0 (released 2006-08-13)

** Change SRP and Cert-Type extensions to match IANA registry.

** Fixed bug in OpenPGP authentication handshake.

** Improvements for building under MinGW.
Provides internal inet_ntop and inet_pton functions and arpa/inet.h
header.  Calls WSAStartup and WSACleanup in gnutls_global_init and
gnutls_global_deinit, respectively.  Loads getaddrinfo and getnameinfo
at run-time from ws2_32.dll, and falls back on a simple replacement if
it is not available.  Builds the library with -mms-bitfields
-Wl,--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc.  Links with --output-def, to
create *.def files, which are installed.

** The examples now (conditionally) include config.h and link to gnulib.
No other source changes were necessary, so the examples should
continue to be possible to use stand-alone without any autoconf or
gnulib stuff.

** Added C++ header "gnutlsxx.h" and library "libgnutlsxx".
You may unconditionally disable it with --disable-cxx.  See
includes/gnutls/gnutlsxx.h and lib/gnutlsxx.cpp for the
implementation.

** Made command line tool '--version' behave according to GNU Standards.
This enables 'make distcheck' to succeed.

** OpenCDK updated to 0.5.9 to fix some problems with OpenPGP support.

** Make --without-included-libtasn1 work.
Reported by Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>.

** Fix a crash (strcmp() on a NULL value) in the certificate verification logic.
See http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html regardging
GNUTLS-SA-2006-2 for more up to date information.  Reported by
satyakumar <satyam_kkd@hyd.hellosoft.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.5 (released 2006-11-06)

** When a GnuTLS server receive a SSLv2 Client Hello for an unknown TLS
** version, try to negotiate the highest version support by the GnuTLS server,
** instead of the lowest.
Reported by <Pasi.Eronen@nokia.com>.

** Fix typo in doc/examples/ex-serv-pgp.c.
Reported by Adam Langley" <agl@imperialviolet.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.4 (released 2006-09-12)

** Relax the test that caught signatures that exploit the variant of
** Bleichenbacher's Crypto 06 rump session attack on our
** verification logic flaw.
In particular, we now permit the digestAlgorithm.parameters field to
be present but empty, whereas in 1.4.3 we actually checked that the
field was absent.

** Revert the removal of debug information for the GNUTLS-SA-2006-3 problem.
The messages are only printed in debug mode, which is not recommended
for normal use, and thus logging this situation cannot be abused as an
oracle in typical recommended situations.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.3 (released 2006-09-08)

** Fix PKCS#1 verification to avoid a variant of Bleichenbacher's
** Crypto 06 rump session attack.
In particular, we check that the digestAlgorithm.parameters field is
empty, to avoid that it can contain "garbage" that may be used to
alter the numeric properties of the signature.  See
<http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg14307.html> (which is

** Fix crash in gnutls_x509_crt_sign2 if passed a NULL issuer_key.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.2 (released 2006-08-12)

** Fix a crash (strcmp() on a NULL value) in the certificate verification logic.
This can happen if you call gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 and have
a certain mix of local CA certificates and the peer send special
certificates, that together trigger certain behaviour.  It is not
known at this point whether the crash can be triggered without the
special local CA certificate, and thus turn this into a remote crash
of clients that verify server certificates when they talk to a server
with the special server certificate.  See GNUTLS-SA-2006-2 on
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html for more up to date
information.  Reported by satyakumar <satyam_kkd@hyd.hellosoft.com>.

** Change SRP and Cert-Type extensions to match IANA registry.

** OpenCDK updated to 0.5.9 to fix some problems with OpenPGP support.

** Make --without-included-libtasn1 work.
Reported by Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2006-06-14)

** Replaced inactive ifdefs to enable openpgp support in test programs.

** Fixed bug in OpenPGP authentication handshake.

** Fixed typographical in man pages.

** Build fixes of the manual.

** Added Swedish translation.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2006-05-15)

** Remove GnuTLS 0.8.x compatibility functions.

** The libgcrypt RNG is initialized in gnutls_global_init().

** TLS/IA API changes from Emile van Bergen.
A dummy credential structure is not needed now, if you wish to use the
low-level TLS/IA API, simply call gnutls_ia_enable to enable TLS/IA on
a session.

** The self-tests are now run under valgrind, if it is installed.

** Libtasn1 is updated to 0.3.4, and that version is now required.

** The command line tools now use getaddrinfo and support IPv6.

** API and ABI modifications:
_gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_activation_time,
_gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_expiration_time: Removed.
gnutls_ia_require_inner_phase: Removed, replaced by gnutls_ia_enable.
gnutls_ia_enable: Added.

* Version 1.3.5 (released 2006-03-08)

** Error messages are now translated using GNU Gettext.

** The function gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml now return an internal error.
This means that the code to convert X.509 certificates to XML format
does not work any more.  The reason is that the function called
libtasn1 internal functions.  It seems unclean for libtasn1 to export
the APIs needed here.  Instead it would be better to implement XML
support inside libtasn1 properly.  If you need this functionality
strongly, please consider looking into implementing this suggested
approach instead.  As a workaround, you may also modify lib/x509/xml.c
(change '#if 1' to '#if 0') and build using --with-included-libtasn1.

** Libraries are now built with libtool's -no-undefined.
This helps producing libraries for Windows using mingw32.

** Doc fixes to explain that gnutls_record_send can block.

** Libtasn1 0.3.1 or later is now required.
The include copy has been updated too.

** gnutls-cli can now recognize services and port numbers with the -p option.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.3.4 (released 2006-02-09)

** Fix read of out bounds bug in DER parser.
Reported by Evgeny Legerov <admin@gleg.net>, and debugging help from
Protover SSL.  Libtasn1 0.2.18 is now required, which contains the
previous bug fix.  The included libtasn1 version in GnuTLS has been
updated.

** Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send() will no 
longer invalidate a session if the underlying send fails, but it will 
prevent future writes. That is to allow reading the already received data.
Patches and bug reports by Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>

** Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory corruption if 
more than one certificates were added. Report and patch by Max Kellermann.

** Fix build problems of OpenCDK on AIX.
Thanks to "Heiden, John" <JHeiden@UTNet.UToledo.Edu>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.3.3 (released 2006-01-12)

** New API to access the TLS master secret.
When possible, you should use the TLS PRF functions instead.
Suggested by Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>.

** Improved handling when multiple libraries use GnuTLS at the same time.
Now gnutls_global_init() can be called multiple times, and
gnutls_global_deinit() will only deallocate the structure when it has
been called as many times as gnutls_global_init() was called.

** Added a self test of TLS resume functionality.

** Fix crash in TLS resume code, caused by TLS/IA changes.

** Documentation fixes about thread unsafety, prompted by
** discussion with bryanh@giraffe-data.com (Bryan Henderson).
In particular, gnutls_global_init() and gnutls_global_deinit() are not
thread safe.  Careful callers may want to protect the call using a
mutex.  The problem could also be ignored, which would cause a memory
leak under rare conditions when two threads invoke the function
roughly at the same time.

** Add 'const' keywords in various places, from Frediano ZIGLIO.

** The code was indented again, including the external header files.

** API and ABI modifications:
New functions to retrieve the master secret value:
  gnutls_session_get_master_secret

Add a 'const' keyword to existing API:
  gnutls_x509_crq_get_challenge_password

* Version 1.3.2 (released 2005-12-15)

** GnuTLS now support TLS Inner application (TLS/IA).
This is per draft-funk-tls-inner-application-extension-01.  This
functionality is added to libgnutls-extra, so it is licensed under the
GNU General Public License.

** New APIs to access the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF).
The PRF is used by some protocols building on TLS, such as EAP-PEAP
and EAP-TTLS.  One function to access the raw PRF and one to access
the PRF seeded with the client/server random fields are provided.
Suggested by Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>.

** New APIs to acceess the client and server random fields in a session.
These fields can be useful by protocols using TLS.  Note that these
fields are typically used as input to the TLS PRF, and if this is your
intended use, you should use the TLS PRF API that use the
client/server random field directly.  Suggested by Jouni Malinen
<jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>.

** Internal type cleanups.
The uint8, uint16, uint32 types have been replaced by uint8_t,
uint16_t, uint32_t.  Gnulib is used to guarantee the presence of
correct types on platforms that lack them.  The uint type have been
replaced by unsigned.

** API and ABI modifications:
New functions to invoke the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF):
  gnutls_prf
  gnutls_prf_raw

New functions to retrieve the session's client and server random values:
  gnutls_session_get_server_random
  gnutls_session_get_client_random

New function, to perform TLS/IA handshake:
  gnutls_ia_handshake

New function to decide whether to do a TLS/IA handshake:
  gnutls_ia_handshake_p

New functions to allocate a TLS/IA credential:
  gnutls_ia_allocate_client_credentials
  gnutls_ia_free_client_credentials
  gnutls_ia_allocate_server_credentials
  gnutls_ia_free_server_credentials

New functions to handle the AVP callback:
  gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_function
  gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_ptr
  gnutls_ia_get_client_avp_ptr
  gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_function
  gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_ptr
  gnutls_ia_get_server_avp_ptr

New functions, to toggle TLS/IA application phases:
  gnutls_ia_require_inner_phase

New function to mix session keys with inner secret:
  gnutls_ia_permute_inner_secret

Low-level API (used internally by gnutls_ia_handshake):
  gnutls_ia_endphase_send
  gnutls_ia_send
  gnutls_ia_recv

New functions that can be used after successful TLS/IA negotiation:
  gnutls_ia_generate_challenge
  gnutls_ia_extract_inner_secret

Enum type with TLS/IA modes:
  gnutls_ia_mode_t

Enum type with TLS/IA packet types:
  gnutls_ia_apptype_t

Enum values for TLS/IA alerts:
  GNUTLS_A_INNER_APPLICATION_FAILURE
  GNUTLS_A_INNER_APPLICATION_VERIFICATION

New error codes, to signal when an application phase has finished:
  GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED
  GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED

New error code to signal TLS/IA verify failure:
  GNUTLS_E_IA_VERIFY_FAILED

* Version 1.3.1 (released 2005-12-08)

** Support for DHE-PSK cipher suites has been added.
This method offers perfect forward secrecy.

** Fix gnutls-cli STARTTLS hang when SIGINT is sent too quickly, thanks to
Otto Maddox <ottomaddox@fastmail.fm> and Nozomu Ando <nand@mac.com>.

** Corrected a bug in certtool for 64 bit machines. Reported
by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** New function to set a X.509 private key and certificate pairs, and/or
CRLs, from an PKCS#12 file, suggested by Emile van Bergen
<emile@e-advies.nl>.

The integrity of the PKCS#12 file is protected through a password
based MAC; public-key based signatures for integrity protection are
not supported.  PKCS#12 bags may be encrypted using password derived
symmetric keys, public-key based encryption is not supported.  The
PKCS#8 keys may be encrypted using passwords.  The API use the same
password for all operations.  We believe that any more flexibility
create too much complexity that would hurt overall security, but may
add more PKCS#12 related APIs if real-world experience indicate
otherwise.

** gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8 now accept unencrypted PEM PKCS#8 keys,
reported by Emile van Bergen <emile@e-advies.nl>.
This will enable "certtool -k -8" to parse those keys.

** Certtool now generate keys in unencrypted PKCS#8 format for empty passwords.
Use "certtool -p -8" and press press enter at the prompt.  Earlier,
certtool would have encrypted the key using an empty password.

** Certtool now accept --password for --key-info and encrypted PKCS#8 keys.
Earlier it would have prompted the user for it, even if --password was
supplied.

** Added self test of PKCS#8 parsing.
Unencrypted and encrypted (pbeWithSHAAnd3-KeyTripleDES-CBC and
pbeWithSHAAnd40BitRC2-CBC) formats are tested.  The test is in
tests/pkcs8.

** API and ABI modifications:
New function to set X.509 credentials from a PKCS#12 file:
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file

New gnutls_kx_algorithm_t enum type:
  GNUTLS_KX_DHE_PSK

New API to return session data (basically same as gnutls_session_get_data):
  gnutls_session_get_data2

New API to set PSK Diffie-Hellman parameters:
  gnutls_psk_set_server_dh_params

* Version 1.3.0 (2005-11-15)

** Support for TLS Pre-Shared Key (TLS-PSK) ciphersuites have been added.
This add several new APIs, see below.  Read the updated manual for
more information.  A new self test "pskself" has been added, that will
test this functionality.

** The session resumption data are now system independent.

** The code has been re-indented to conform to the GNU coding style.

** Removed the RIPEMD ciphersuites.

** Added a discussion of the internals of gnutls in manual.

** Fixes for Tru64 UNIX 4.0D that lack MAP_FAILED, from Albert Chin.

** Remove trailing comma in enums, for IBM C v6, from Albert Chin.

** Make sure config.h is included first in a few files, from Albert Chin.

** Don't use C++ comments ("//") as they are invalid, from Albert Chin.

** Don't install SRP programs and man pages if --disable-srp-authentication,
from Albert Chin.

** API and ABI modifications:
New gnutls_kx_algorithm_t key exchange type: GNUTLS_KX_PSK

New gnutls_credentials_type_t credential type:
  GNUTLS_CRD_PSK

New credential types:
  gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t
  gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t

New functions to allocate PSK credentials:
  gnutls_psk_allocate_client_credentials
  gnutls_psk_free_client_credentials
  gnutls_psk_free_server_credentials
  gnutls_psk_allocate_server_credentials

New enum type for PSK key flags:
  gnutls_psk_key_flags

New function prototypes for credential callback:
  gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function
  gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function

New function to set PSK username and key:
  gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials

New function to set PSK passwd file:
  gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file

New function to extract PSK user in server:
  gnutls_psk_server_get_username

New functions to set PSK callback:
  gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function
  gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function

Use size_t instead of int for output size parameter:

  gnutls_srp_base64_decode

* Version 1.2.11 (2006-05-11)
- The function gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml is not supported any more, and
  return an internal error.  The reason is that the function called
  internal libtasn1 functions which are no longer exported from
  libtasn1.
- Updated libtasn1 requirement to 0.3.4 and refreshed internal mintiasn1.
- Updated gnulib compatibility files.
- Fixed _gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_expiration_time and
  _gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_activation_time to return (time_t)-1 on errors.
- API and ABI modifications:
  No changes since last version.

* Version 1.2.10 (2006-02-09)
- Fix read out bounds bug in DER parser.  Reported by Evgeny Legerov
  <admin@gleg.net>, and debugging help from Protover SSL.
- Libtasn1 0.2.18 is now required (contains the previous bug fix).
  The included version has been updated too.
- Fix gnutls-cli STARTTLS hang when SIGINT is sent too quickly, thanks to
  Otto Maddox <ottomaddox@fastmail.fm> and Nozomu Ando <nand@mac.com>.
- Corrected a bug in certtool for 64 bit machines. Reported
  by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.
- Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory corruption if
  more than one certificates were added. Report and patch by Max Kellermann.
- Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send() will no 
  longer invalidate a session if the underlying send fails, but it will 
  prevent future writes. That is to allow reading the already received data.
  Patches and bug reports by Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>

* Version 1.2.9 (2005-11-07)
- Documentation was updated and improved.
- RSA-MD2 is now supported for verifying digital signatures.
- Due to cryptographic advances, verifying untrusted X.509
  certificates signed with RSA-MD2 or RSA-MD5 will now fail with a
  GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM verification output.  For
  applications that must remain interoperable, you can use the
  GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2 or GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5
  flags when verifying certificates.  Naturally, this is not
  recommended default behaviour for applications.  To enable the
  broken algorithms, call gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags with the
  proper flag, to change the verification mode used by
  gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2.
- Make it possible to send empty data through gnutls_record_send,
  to align with the send(2) API.
- Some changes in the certificate receiving part of handshake to prevent
  some possible errors with non-blocking servers.
- Added numeric version symbols to permit simple CPP-based feature
  tests, suggested by Daniel Stenberg <daniel@haxx.se>.
- The (experimental) low-level crypto alternative to libgcrypt used
  earlier (Nettle) has been replaced with crypto code from gnulib.
  This leads to easier re-use of these components in other projects,
  leading to more review and simpler maintenance.  The new configure
  parameter --with-builtin-crypto replace the old --with-nettle, and
  must be used if you wish to enable this functionality.  See README
  under "Experimental" for more information.  Internally, GnuTLS has
  been updated to use the new "Generic Crypto" API in gl/gc.h.  The
  API is similar to the old crypto/gc.h, because the gnulib code were
  based on GnuTLS's gc.h.
- Fix compiler warning in the "anonself" self test.
- API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: Added 'const' to prototype in <gnutls/x509.h>.
                             This doesn't reflect a change in behaviour,
                             so we don't break backwards compatibility.
GNUTLS_MAC_MD2: New gnutls_mac_algorithm_t value.
GNUTLS_DIG_MD2: New gnutls_digest_algorithm_t value.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2,
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5: New gnutls_certificate_verify_flags values.
                                  Use when calling
                                  gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify,
                                  gnutls_x509_crt_verify, or
                                  gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags.
GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM: New gnutls_certificate_status_t value,
                                used when broken signature algorithms
                                is used (currently RSA-MD2/MD5).
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR,
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MINOR,
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_PATCH,
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER: New CPP symbols, indicating the GnuTLS
			  version number, can be used for feature existence
			  tests.

* Version 0.2.90 (2001-12-07)
- gnutls_handshake(), gnutls_read() etc. functions no longer require
  the 'SOCKET cd' argument. This argument is set using the function
  gnutls_set_transport_ptr().
