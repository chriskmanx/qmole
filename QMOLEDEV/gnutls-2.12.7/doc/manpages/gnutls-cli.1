.SH NAME
gnutls\-cli \- GnuTLS test client
.SH SYNOPSIS
gnutls\-cli [\fIoptions\fR] \fIhostname\fI
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some other
computer.  It sets up a TLS connection and forwards data from the
standard input to the secured socket and vice versa.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Program control options
.IP "\-d, \-\-debug LEVEL"
Specify the debug level. Default is 1.
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints a short reminder of the command line options.
.IP "\-l, \-\-list"
Print a list of the supported algorithms and modes.
.IP "\-r, \-\-resume"
Connect, establish a session.  Connect again and resume this session.
.IP "\-s, \-\-starttls"
Connect, establish a plain session and start TLS when EOF or a SIGALRM
is received.
.IP "\-v, \-\-version"
Prints the program's version number.
.IP "\-V, \-\-verbose"
More verbose output.

.SS TLS/SSL control options
.IP "\-\-priority \fIPRIORITY STRING\fR"
TLS algorithms and protocols to enable.
You can use predefined sets of ciphersuites such as: 
.IP
.B "PERFORMANCE"
all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled, limited to 128 bit
ciphers and sorted by terms of speed performance.
.IP 
.B "NORMAL" 
option enables all "secure" ciphersuites. The 256-bit ciphers
are included as a fallback only. The ciphers are sorted by security
margin.
.IP 
.B "SECURE128" 
flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites with ciphers up to
128 bits, sorted by security margin.
.IP 
.B "SECURE256" 
flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites including the 256 bit
ciphers, sorted by security margin.
.IP 
.B "EXPORT" 
all the ciphersuites are enabled, including the
low-security 40 bit ciphers.
.IP 
.B "NONE" 
nothing is enabled. This disables even protocols and
compression methods.

.IP
Check the GnuTLS manual on section "Priority strings" for
more information on allowed keywords.
.IP 
.B Examples:
.IP 
"NORMAL"
.IP 
"NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"
.IP 
"NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128" means normal ciphers except for ARCFOUR-128.
.IP 
"SECURE:-VERS-SSL3.0:+COMP-DEFLATE" means that only secure ciphers are
enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled, and libz compression enabled.
.IP
 "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1"
.IP 
"NORMAL:%COMPAT" is the most compatible mode

.IP "\-\-crlf"
Send CR LF instead of LF.

supported MACs).
.IP "\-\-kx \fIkx1 kx2...\fR"
Key exchange methods to enable (use \fBgnutls\-cli \-\-list\fR to
show the supported methods).
.IP "\-\-ctypes \fIcertType1 certType2...\fR"
Certificate types to enable (use \fBgnutls\-cli \-\-list\fR to show
the supported types).
.IP "\-\-recordsize \fIinteger\fR"
The maximum record size to advertize.
.IP "\-\-disable-extensions"
Disable all the TLS extensions.
.IP "\-\-print-cert"
Print the certificate in PEM format.
.IP "\-\-insecure"
Don't abort program if server certificates can't be validated.
