.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " res ", const char * " certfile ", const char * " keyfile ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " type ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * certfile" 12
is a file that containing the certificate list (path) for
the specified private key, in PKCS7 format, or a list of certificates
.IP "const char * keyfile" 12
is a file that contains the private key
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type" 12
is PEM or DER
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once (in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server).  For clients that wants to send more than its own end
entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
the certificate chain in \fIcertfile\fP.

Currently only PKCS\-1 encoded RSA and DSA private keys are accepted by
this function.

This function can also accept PKCS \fB11\fP URLs. In that case it
will import the private key and certificate indicated by the urls.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
