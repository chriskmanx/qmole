.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will try to verify the peer's certificate and return
its status (trusted, invalid etc.).  The value of \fIstatus\fP should
be one or more of the gnutls_certificate_status_t enumerated
elements bitwise or'd. To avoid denial of service attacks some
default upper limits regarding the certificate key size and chain
size are set. To override them use
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits()\fP.

Note that you must also check the peer's name in order to check if
the verified certificate belongs to the actual peer.

This function uses \fBgnutls_x509_crt_list_verify()\fP with the CAs in
the credentials as trusted CAs.
.SH "RETURNS"
a negative error code on error and zero on success.
