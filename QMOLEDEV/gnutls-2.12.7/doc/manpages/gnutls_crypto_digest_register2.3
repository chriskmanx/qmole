.SH NAME
gnutls_crypto_digest_register2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_digest_register2(int " priority ", int " version ", const gnutls_crypto_digest_st * " s ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the digest interface
.IP "int version" 12
should be set to \fBGNUTLS_CRYPTO_API_VERSION\fP
.IP "const gnutls_crypto_digest_st * s" 12
is a structure holding new interface's data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a digest interface to be used by
gnutls. Any interface registered will override the included engine
and by convention kernel implemented interfaces should have
priority of 90. The interface with the lowest priority will be used
by gnutls.

This function should be called before \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.

For simplicity you can use the convenience
\fBgnutls_crypto_digest_register()\fP macro.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.
.SH "SINCE"
2.6.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
