.SH NAME
gnutls_handshake_set_post_client_hello_function \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS

.sp
.BI "void gnutls_handshake_set_post_client_hello_function(gnutls_session_t " session ", gnutls_handshake_post_client_hello_func                                                  " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_handshake_post_client_hello_func                                                  func" 12
is the function to be called
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set a callback to be called after the client
hello has been received (callback valid in server side only). This
allows the server to adjust settings based on received extensions.

Those settings could be ciphersuites, requesting certificate, or
anything else except for version negotiation (this is done before
the hello message is parsed).

This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error code to
terminate the handshake.
.SH "WARNING"
You should not use this function to terminate the
handshake based on client input unless you know what you are
doing. Before the handshake is finished there is no way to know if
there is a man\-in\-the\-middle attack being performed.
