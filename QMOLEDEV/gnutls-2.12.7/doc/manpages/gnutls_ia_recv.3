.SH NAME
gnutls_ia_recv \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/extra.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_ia_recv(gnutls_session_t " session ", char * " data ", size_t " sizeofdata ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "char * data" 12
the buffer that the data will be read into, must hold >= 12 bytes.
.IP "size_t sizeofdata" 12
the number of requested bytes, must be >= 12.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Receive TLS/IA data.  This function has the similar semantics with
\fBrecv()\fP.  The only difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session,
and uses different error codes.

If the server attempt to finish an application phase, this function
will return \fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED\fP.  The caller should then invoke
\fBgnutls_ia_verify_endphase()\fP, and if it runs the client side, also
send an endphase message of its own using gnutls_ia_endphase_send.

If EINTR is returned by the internal push function (the default is
\fIcode\fP{\fBrecv()\fP}) then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be returned.  If
GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is returned, you must call
this function again, with the same parameters; alternatively you
could provide a NULL pointer for data, and 0 for size.
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of bytes received.  A negative error code is
returned in case of an error.  The
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED\fP and
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED\fP errors are returned when an
application phase finished message has been sent by the server.
