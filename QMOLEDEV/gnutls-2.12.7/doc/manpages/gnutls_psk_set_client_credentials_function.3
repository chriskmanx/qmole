.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username and
password for client PSK authentication.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username,
gnutls_datum_t* key);

The \fIusername\fP and \fIkey\fP\->data must be allocated using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.
\fIusername\fP should be ASCII strings or UTF\-8 strings prepared using
the "SASLprep" profile of "stringprep".

The callback function will be called once per handshake.

The callback function should return 0 on success.
\-1 indicates an error.
