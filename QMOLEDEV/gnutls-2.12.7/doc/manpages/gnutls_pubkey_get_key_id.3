.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pubkey_get_key_id(gnutls_pubkey_t " key ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned char * " output_data ", size_t * " output_data_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pubkey_t key" 12
Holds the public key
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be 0 for now
.IP "unsigned char * output_data" 12
will contain the key ID
.IP "size_t * output_data_size" 12
holds the size of output_data (and will be
replaced by the actual size of parameters)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return a unique ID the depends on the public
key parameters. This ID can be used in checking whether a

be returned.  The output will normally be a SHA\-1 hash output,
which is 20 bytes.
