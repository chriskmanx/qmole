.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Used to disabled padding in TLS 1.0 and above.  Normally you do not
need to use this function, but there are buggy clients that
complain if a server pads the encrypted data.  This of course will
disable protection against statistical attacks on the data.

Normally only servers that require maximum compatibility with everything
out there, need to call this function.
