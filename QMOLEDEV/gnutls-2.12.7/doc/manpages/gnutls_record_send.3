.SH NAME
gnutls_record_send \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_send(gnutls_session_t " session ", const void * " data ", size_t " sizeofdata ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "const void * data" 12
contains the data to send
.IP "size_t sizeofdata" 12
is the length of the data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function has the similar semantics with \fBsend()\fP.  The only
difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
error codes.

Note that if the send buffer is full, \fBsend()\fP will block this
function.  See the \fBsend()\fP documentation for full information.  You
can replace the default push function by using
\fBgnutls_transport_set_ptr2()\fP with a call to \fBsend()\fP with a
MSG_DONTWAIT flag if blocking is a problem.

If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function (the
default is \fBsend()\fP} then \fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP will be returned. If
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP or \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP is returned, you must
call this function again, with the same parameters; alternatively
you could provide a \fBNULL\fP pointer for data, and 0 for
size. cf. \fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
the number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The
number of bytes sent might be less than \fIsizeofdata\fP.  The maximum
number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends
on the negotiated maximum record size.
