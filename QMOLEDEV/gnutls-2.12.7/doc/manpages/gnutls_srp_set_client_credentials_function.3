.IP "gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function                                             * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
username and password for client SRP authentication.  The
callback's function form is:

int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username, char**password);

The \fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP must be allocated using
\fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.  \fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP should be ASCII strings
or UTF\-8 strings prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of
"stringprep".

The callback function will be called once per handshake before the
initial hello message is sent.

The callback should not return a negative error code the second
time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

The callback function should return 0 on success.
\-1 indicates an error.
