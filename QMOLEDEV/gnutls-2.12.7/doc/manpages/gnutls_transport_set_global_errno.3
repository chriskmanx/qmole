.SH NAME
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_transport_set_global_errno(int " err ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "int err" 12
error value to store in global errno variable.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Store \fIerr\fP in the global errno variable.  Useful values for \fIerr\fP is
EAGAIN and EINTR, other values are treated will be treated as real
errors in the push/pull function.

This function is useful in replacement push/pull functions set by
gnutls_transport_set_push_function and
gnutls_transport_set_pullpush_function under Windows, where the
replacement push/pull may not have access to the same \fIerrno\fP
variable that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to
msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

Whether this function is thread safe or not depends on whether the
global variable errno is thread safe, some system libraries make it
a thread\-local variable.  When feasible, using the guaranteed
thread\-safe \fBgnutls_transport_set_errno()\fP may be better.
