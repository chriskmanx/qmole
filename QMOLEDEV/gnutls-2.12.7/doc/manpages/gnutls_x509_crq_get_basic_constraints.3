.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_get_basic_constraints(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", unsigned int * " critical ", int * " ca ", int * " pathlen ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crq_t\fP structure
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non zero if the extension is marked as critical
.IP "int * ca" 12
pointer to output integer indicating CA status, may be NULL,
value is 1 if the certificate CA flag is set, 0 otherwise.
.IP "int * pathlen" 12
pointer to output integer indicating path length (may be
NULL), non\-negative values indicate a present pathLenConstraint
field and the actual value, \-1 indicate that the field is absent.
