.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const char * " oid ", int " indx ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "const char * oid" 12
holds an Object Identified in null terminated string
.IP "int indx" 12
In case multiple same OIDs exist in the extensions, this specifies which to send. Use zero to get the first one.
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
initially holds the size of \fIbuf\fP
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non zero if the extension is marked as critical
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the extension specified by the OID in the
certificate.  The extensions will be returned as binary data DER
encoded, in the provided buffer.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (zero) is returned,
otherwise an error code is returned. If the certificate does not
