.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", const gnutls_datum_t * " signature ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * " hash ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
Holds the certificate
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * signature" 12
contains the signature
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * hash" 12
The result of the call with the hash algorithm used for signature
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will read the certifcate and the signed data to
determine the hash algorithm used to generate the signature.
.SH "DEPRECATED"
Use \fBgnutls_pubkey_get_verify_algorithm()\fP instead.
.SH "RETURNS"
the 0 if the hash algorithm is found. A negative value is
returned on error.
