This is the Dnd package, which provides for specification and sample
code (Xlib based) of the Motif Drag&Drop protocol.

This was (partly) developed as part of the CDE/Motif PST project by
the X Consortium.

It is currently available thru the OSF web site.

Technical questions should be redirected to XC 
(Daniel Dardailler - daniel@x.org).

./doc:
       Ascii version of the D&D spec.
       The final version of this spec should appear sometimes next
       year (97) as a new X/Open Motif spec.

./lib: 
       libDnd code, which provides sample code for D&D messaging format
       and target management. only Xlib required.

./programs:
       example program using libDnd APIs and Xaw (Athena widgets). no Motif.
       (to build: make in ../lib first, and then make here.)


STATUS (May 96):
	- lib/Dnd.c should be OK
	- incomplete support for target management (see lib/Target.c)
	- no real doc on the libDnd API, just the protocol.
	- the demo program sucks, aka bolognese C code, selection
          convert is dumb, etc. No time to clean.
        - there is a warning coming from Motif when acting as source
          for demos/dnd that I don't like...   
        - no test for changing operation in the demo
	- the drag selection is not session-unique, it should be.
	- I ought to expose the _MOTIF_WM_QUERY protocol to get the
	  top levels. Also, you can't drag on a top level that was
	  created after you start the demo, since it does not track
	  creation.
        - gotta use Imakefile, but the Makefiles are 3 lines each.
