 * @see_also: #WnckWindow, #WnckWorkspace
 * @stability: Unstable
 *
 * The #WnckScreen represents a physical screen. A screen may consist of
 * multiple monitors which are merged to form a large screen area. The
 * #WnckScreen is at the bottom of the libwnck stack of objects: #WnckWorkspace
 * objects exist a #WnckScreen and #WnckWindow objects are displayed on a
 * #WnckWorkspace.
 *
 * The #WnckScreen corresponds to the notion of
 * <classname>GdkScreen</classname> in GDK.
 *
 * The #WnckScreen objects are always owned by libwnck and must not be
 * referenced or unreferenced.
