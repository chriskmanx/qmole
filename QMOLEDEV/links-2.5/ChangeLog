	Pergel doesn't have time to develop it and code is so messy that no one
	else can understand it.

	If you use links for special purposes (embedded devices, etc.), you can
	bring javascript back by copying javascript files from previous release,
	removing "dnl javascript" lines from configure.in, adding *.c and *.h
	files to Makefile.am and re-running automake and autoconf.

	work. Don't even try to fix it unless you have computers with Windows
	NT, Window 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista side by side.

	(new Cygwin emulates xterm-like mouse on the console, so it's not needed
