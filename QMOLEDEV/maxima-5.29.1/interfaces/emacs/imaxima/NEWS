* Changes in imaxima-imath 1.0 rc1
** As for inline graph, if the emacs buffer window is too small for
   the generated graph image, the graph is not displayed, but a file
   name is displayed instead. Now, the graph is resized to fit to the
   current imaxima buffer size and correctly displayed. Thanks go to
   Bertram for his patch.
** A bug in setup-imaxima-imath.el, which is used in "Easy Install on
   Windows XP / Vista" is fixed so that it can now correctly handles
   the set up of info files.
** Now csetup() function in ctensor package displays interactive
   messages correctly.
** derivabbrev:true is correctly handled.
** A lot of lisp code in imaxima.lisp that are common in mactex.lisp are removed.


* Changes in imaxima-imath 1.0 beta2

** Workaround for OpenSUSE Linux is included.

* Changes in imaxima-imath 1.0 beta

** bohumir's patch for {eps xxx eps} is included.
** Inline graph support in both imaxima and imath is added.
** I have decided this version to be 1.0 beta. 

* Changes in imaxima-imath 0.98

** Greek letter gamma is better handled in imaxima.
** Conjugate symbol is handled correctly in imaxima.
** imaxima-to-html function, which converts imaxima
session buffer to HTML format, is added.

* Changes in imaxima-imath 0.97a

** imaxima-imath causes an error when used with Maxima 5.11.99rc1
and later (including 5.12.0). This is due to the fact that memq()
is removed from Maxima source code. Now imaxima.lisp implements
its own memq().

* Changes in imaxima-imath 0.97

** demo() prompts _ and waits for input of ; by the user.
This behavior is now supported in the imaxima. As usual, you can type
; when _ is displayed. Then the next demo is presented.

** When maxima string is printed, imaxima eats all the white space
and all the non-white space chars are concatenated. This version
fixes this so that all the white space including newline chars are
treated appropriately.

** When you pass numbers to print function, an error occured.
This is fixed and appropriate value is now printed nicely.

** When imaxima is used with maxima mode i.e.,
(setq imaxima-use-maxima-mode-flag t) and the maxima compiled with
clisp is used, the first prompt does not appear appropriately. This
is fixed.

** When batch() is called, imaxima processed the input line using
latex and gs, which sometimes caused processing errors. Now the
input lines are all displayed as ordinally input text and not
processed by latex nor gs.

* Changes in imaxima-imath 0.96

** Repeated large scale testing of imaxima, including enable/disable 
maxima mode, deleting *maxima*/*imaxima* buffers may cause maxima 
process filter function to cause wrong type error on calling
process-mark function. This bug is fixed.

** When SBCL was used as the underlying lisp for Imaxima, it
generates a lot of style warning of function redefinitions when
imaxima.lisp was loaded. Thanks to the suggestion from the SBCL
developer, this bug was fixed.

** A new interactive function (imaxima-version) is added. This
function displays autoconf package name and version. Currently
they are imaxima-imath 0.96. Also two variables:
    *imaxima-autoconf-package-name*
    *imaxima-autoconf-version*
are available in Emacs lisp.


* Changes in imaxima-imath 0.95

** imaxima-imath supports Maxima 5.10.0. Support for Maxima prior
to 5.9.2 is discontinued. You need to update Maxima at lease 5.9.2.
The latest release 5.10.0 is recommended.

* Changes in imaxima version 0.94

** Imaxima has been independently developed from imath. Now imath is updated to incorporate all the changes to imaxima.el up to 0.93a.

* Changes in imaxima version 0.91

** Add new functionality "imath-mode" provided by imath.el

** Small modifications in imaxima.el to support imath-mode.

* Changes in imaxima version 0.9

** Fix compatibility problem with CLISP 2.29.

** Fix compatibility problem with new prompt in Maxima 5.9.0.9beta2.

* Changes in imaxima version 0.8

** Fix Texlive dumping problem

Change the name of the TeX executable called to fix dumping of format
files in Texlive.

** LaTeX fix

Fix bug in powers of matrix elements.

** imaxima-equation-color

Default to foreground colour of the current frame.

** CLISP 2.32

Suppress warnings when loading imaxima.lisp in CLISP 2.32.

* Changes in version 0.7

** imaxima-scale-factor

New option for more fine-grained control of font sizes.

** ESP Ghostscript

Workaround for this broken Ghostscript version.

** LaTeX fixes

Fix a bug with expressions containing `and', `or' and `not'.

* Changes in version 0.6

** Works on Microsoft Windows

Imaxima now works with XEmacs on Windows.

** Miscellaneous small changes

Rewrite long square roots if applicable.  There's now a start and exit
hook.  Load imaxima.lisp from the command line to avoid two (C1) lines
when starting.

* Changes in version 0.5

** GNU Ghostscript 7.05

Include a workaround for this broken version of Ghostscript.

** imaxima-maxima-options

New option.  Command line options passed to Maxima.  Can be used to
select which Lisp to use.

** Rename ps to postscript

Rename value of `imaxima-image-type' from ps to postscript to allow
better error diagnostics.

** Various bug fixes

Merge some fixes and improvements from the Maxima version of
mactex.lisp.  Avoid compiler warnings when using CMUCL.  Avoid having
TeX balk at directories with underscores.

* Changes in version 0.4

** Colors

Colors work better for more background colors.  Also, the background
color isn't changed by default in XEmacs.

** Speed improvement

We now dump a TeX format file with the required definitions
pre-loaded.  This makes TeX start up twice as fast and the total time
to generate an image is reduced by 30%.

** Various bug fixes

Scaling and linearizing was broken in the last version.  Mouse clicks
didn't work in XEmacs.


* Changes in version 0.3

** Ghostscript

Imaxima now works with the latest version of Ghostscript (7.04).

** Colors

The background and foreground color of the buffer is now customizable.
The colors are changed by default in XEmacs, because it can't make the
image background transparent.

** Temporary files

Don't create temporary files in a directory that is world writable.
Also, temporary files were previously not removed in XEmacs.

** LaTeX fixes

Various LaTeX fixes and improvements.

** Don't break Gnus

Removed an alias that broke Gnus.


* Changes in version 0.2

** XEmacs support

Imaxima now works with XEmacs.  Since the ms-windows port of XEmacs
supports images, it might be possible to use it on Windows.  I haven't
got a Windows box myself, though, so I can't test it.

** LaTeX fixes

Fixed a bug where an expression like sin(x)^2 would cause a LaTeX
error.  Binomials are now displayed properly, and more trig functions
are printed nicer.

** Smarter line breaking

Be smarter when rewriting expressions to allow line breaking.
Exponentials and subscripts aren't rewritten if the exponent/subscript
is an atom, and unnecessary bracket are avoided in fractions if the
denominator or numerator is an atom.

* Changes in version 0.1.1

** Oops

Include `imaxima.el' in the tarball.

* Changes in version 0.1

** Line breaking

Imaxima can break wide fractions, subscripts and superscripts by
either scaling the image down or rewriting the equation in a linear
format, which allows line breaking.

This can be customized with `imaxima-scale' and
`imaxima-linearize-flag'.

** Manual & configure script

A Texinfo manual and a configure script is included.

** maxima.el

To enable the major mode from `maxima.el' when invoking imaxima set
`imaxima-use-maxima-mode-flag' to t.


Local variables:
mode: outline
paragraph-separate: "[ 	]*$"
