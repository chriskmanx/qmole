% \part*{User's guide}
%
% \section{A bit of history}
%
% Originally \pkg{breqn}, \pkg{flexisym}, and \pkg{mathstyle} were
% created by Michael J.~Downes from the American Mathematical Society
% during the 1990's up to late 2002. Sadly---and much to the shock of
% the \TeX\ world---Michael passed away in early 2003 at the age of
% only~44.
%
% The American Mathematical Society has kindly allowed me to assume
% maintainership of this part of his work and I wish to express my
% gratitude to them and to Barbara Beeton in particular for providing
% me with the files I needed.
%
% I hope to continue Michael's work, thereby allowing users to create
% more \emph{masterpieces of the publishing art} as I think he would
% have wanted.
%
% 
%
% \section{Package loading}
%
%
% The recommended way of loading the \pkg{breqn} package is to load it
% \emph{after} other packages dealing with math, \ie, after
% \pkg{amsmath}, \pkg{amssymb}, or packages such as \pkg{mathpazo} or
% \pkg{mathptmx}. 
% 
% The \pkg{flexisym} package (described in section \vref{flexisym}) is
% required by \pkg{breqn} and ensures the math symbols are set up
% correctly. By default \pkg{breqn} loads it with support for Computer
% Modern but if you use a different math package requiring slightly
% different definitions, it must be loaded before \pkg{breqn}. Below
% is an example of how you enable \pkg{breqn} to work with the widely
% used \pkg{mathpazo} package.
% \begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage{mathpazo}
%\usepackage[mathpazo]{flexisym}
%\usepackage{breqn}
% \end{verbatim}
% Currently, the packages \pkg{mathpazo} and \pkg{mathptmx} are
% supported. Despair not: Chances are that the package will work using
% the default settings. If you find that a particular math font
% package doesn't work then please see implementation in
% \fn{flexisym.dtx} for how to create a support file---it is easier
% than one might think. Contributions welcome.
%
% The documentation for the package was formerly found in
% \fn{breqndoc}. It has now been added to this implementation
% file. Below follows the contents of the original \pkg{breqn}
% documentation. Not all details hold anymore but I have prioritized
% fixing the package.
%
% \section{To do}
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Handling of QED
% \item Space between \verb'\end{dmath}' and following punctuation will
% prevent the punctuation from being drawn into the equation.
% \item Overriding the equation layout
% \item Overriding the placement of the equation number
% \item \qq{alignid} option for more widely separated equations where
%   shared alignment is desired (requires two passes)
% \item Or maybe provide an \qq{alignwidths} option where you give
%   lhs/rhs width in terms of ems? And get feedback later on discrepancies
%   with the actual measured contents?
% \item \cs{intertext} not needed within dgroup! But currently there are
%   limitations on floating objects within dgroup.
% \item \verb'align={1}' or 2, 3, 4 expressing various levels of demand
%   for group-wide alignment. Level 4 means force alignment even if some
%   lines then have to run over the right margin! Level 1, the default,
%   means first break LHS-RHS equations as if it occurred by itself, then
%   move them left or right within the current line width to align them if
%   possible. Levels 2 and 3 mean try harder to align but give up if
%   overfull lines result.
% \item Need an \cs{hshift} command to help with alignment of
%   lines broken at a discretionary times sign. Also useful for adjusting
%   inside-delimiter breaks.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \section{Introduction}
%
% The \pkg{breqn} package for \LaTeX\ provides solutions to a number of
% common difficulties in writing displayed equations and getting
% high-quality output. For example, it is a well-known inconvenience that
% if an equation must be broken into more than one line, \cs{left} \dots\
% \cs{right} constructs cannot span lines. The \pkg{breqn} package makes
% them work as one would expect whether or not there is an intervening
% line break.
%
% The single most ambitious goal of the \pkg{breqn} package, however, is
% to support automatic linebreaking of displayed equations. Such
% linebreaking cannot be done without substantial changes under the hood
% in the way math formulas are processed. For this reason, especially in
% the alpha release, users should proceed with care and keep an eye out
% for unexpected glitches or side effects.
%
% \section{Principal features}
% The principal features of the \pkg{breqn} package are:
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[semantically oriented structure] The way in which compound
% displayed formulas are subdivided matches the logical structure more
% closely than, say, the standard \env{eqnarray} environment. Separate
% equations in a group of equations are written as separate environments
% instead of being bounded merely by \dbslash/ commands. Among other
% things, this clears up a common problem of wrong math symbol spacing at
% the beginning of continuation lines. It also makes it possible to
% specify different vertical space values for the space between lines of a
% long, broken equation and the space between separate equations in a
% group of equations.
%
% \item[automatic line breaking] Overlong equations will be broken
% automatically to the prevailing column width, and continuation lines
% will be indented following standard conventions.
%
% \item[line breaks within delimiters] Line breaks within \cs{left} \dots\
% \cs{right} delimiters work in a natural way. Line breaks can be
% forbidden below a given depth of delimiter nesting through a package
% option.
%
% \item[mixed math and text] Display equations that contain mixed
% math and text, or even text only, are handled naturally by means of a
% \env{dseries} environment that starts out in text mode instead of math
% mode.
%
% \item[ending punctuation] The punctuation at the end of a displayed
% equation can be handled in a natural way that makes it easier to promote
% or demote formulas from\slash to inline math, and to apply special
% effects such as adding space before the punctuation.
%
% \item[flexible numbering] Equation numbering is handled in a natural
% way, with all the flexibility of the \pkg{amsmath} package and with no
% need for a special \cs{nonumber} command.
%
% \item[special effects] It is easy to apply special effects to individual
% displays, e.g., changing the type size or adding a frame.
%
% \item[using available space] Horizontal shrink is made use of
% whenever feasible. With most other equation macros it is frozen when it
% occurs between \cs{left} \dots\ \cs{right} delimiters, or in any sort of
% multiline structure, so that some expressions require two lines that would
% otherwise fit on one.
%
% \item[high-quality spacing] The \cs{abovedisplayshortskip} is used when
% applicable (other equation macros fail to apply it in equations of more
% than one line).
%
% \item[abbreviations] Unlike the \pkg{amsmath} equation environments, the
% \pkg{breqn} environments can be called through user-defined abbreviations
% such as \cs{beq} \dots\ \cs{eeq}.
%
% \end{description}
%
% \section{Shortcomings of the package}
% The principal known deficiencies of the \pkg{breqn} package are:
%
% \subsection{Incompatibilities} As it pushes the envelope
% of what is possible within the context of \LaTeXe, \thepkg will tend
% to break other packages when used in combination with them, or to fail
% itself, when there are any areas of internal overlap; successful use may
% in some cases depend on package loading order.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Indention of delimited fragments} When line breaks within
% delimiters are involved, the automatic indention of continuation lines
% is likely to be unsatisfactory and need manual adjustment. I don't see
% any easy way to provide a general solution for this, though I have some
% ideas on how to attain partial improvements.
%
% \subsection{Math symbol subversion}
% In order for automatic line breaking to work, the operation of all the
% math symbols of class 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be altered (relations, binary
% operators, opening delimiters, closing delimiters). This is done by an
% auxiliary package \pkg{flexisym}. As long as you stick to the advertised
% \LaTeX\ interface for defining math symbols (\cs{DeclareMathSymbol}),
% things should work OK most of the time. Any more complex math symbol
% setup is quite likely to quarrel with the \pkg{flexisym} package.
% See Section~\vref{flexisym} for further information.
%
% \subsection{Subscripts and superscripts}
%
% Because of the changes to math symbols of class 2--5, writing certain
% combinations such as \verb'^+' or \verb'_\pm' or \verb'^\geq' without
% braces would lead to error messages; (The problem described here
% already exists in standard \LaTeX\ to a lesser extent, as you may know
% if you ever tried \verb'^\neq' or \verb'^\cong'; and indeed there are
% no examples in the \LaTeX\ book to indicate any sanction for omitting
% braces around a subscript or superscript.)
%
% The \pkg{flexisym} package therefore calls, as of version 0.92, another
% package called \pkg{mathstyle} which turns \verb'^' and \verb'_' into
% active characters. This is something that I believe is desirable in any
% case, in the long run, because having a proper mathstyle variable
% eliminates some enormous burdens that affect almost any
% nontrivial math macros, as well as many other things where the
% connection is not immediately obvious, e.g., the \LaTeX\ facilities for
% loading fonts on demand.
%
% Not that this doesn't introduce new and interesting problems of its
% own---for example, you don't want to put usepackage statements
% after flexisym for any package that refers to, e.g., \verb'^^J' or 
% \verb'^^M'
% internally (too bad that the \LaTeX\ package loading code does not
% include automatic defenses to ensure normal catcodes in the interior of
% a package; but it only handles the \verb'@' character).
%
% But I took a random AMS journal article, with normal end-user kind of
% \LaTeX\ writing, did some straightforward substitutions to change all
% the equations into dmath environments, and ran it with active math
% sub/sup: everything worked OK. This suggests to me that it can work in
% the real world, without an impossible amount of compatibility work.
%
% \section{Incomplete}
% In addition, in the \textbf{alpha release [1997/10/30]} the following
% gaps remain to be filled in:
% \begin{description}
% \item[documentation]
% The documentation could use amplification, especially more
% illustrations, and I have undoubtedly overlooked more than a few errors.
%
% \item[group alignment] The algorithm for doing alignment
% of mathrel symbols across equations in a \env{dgroup} environment 
% needs work. Currently the standard and \opt{noalign} alternatives
% produce the same output.
%
% \item[single group number] When a \env{dgroup} has a group number and
% the individual equations are unnumbered, the handling and placement of
% the group number aren't right.
%
% \item[group frame] Framing a group doesn't work, you might be able to
% get frames on the individual equations at best.
%
% \item[group brace] The \opt{brace} option for \env{dgroup} is intended
% to produce a large brace encompassing the whole group. This hasn't been
% implemented yet.
%
% \item[darray environment] The \env{darray} environment is unfinished.
%
% \item[dseries environment] The syntax and usage for the \env{dseries}
% environment are in doubt and may change.
%
% \item[failure arrangements] When none of the line-breaking passes for a
% \env{dmath} environment succeeds\dash i.e., at least one line is
% overfull\dash the final arrangement is usually rather poor. A better
% fall-back arrangement in the failure case is needed.
%
% \end{description}
%
% \section{Package options}
%
% Many of the package options for \thepkg are the same as options of the
% \env{dmath} or \env{dgroup} environments, and some of them require an
% argument, which is something that cannot be done through the normal
% package option mechanism. Therefore most of the \pkg{breqn} package
% options are designed to be set with a \cs{setkeys} command after the
% package is loaded. For example, to load the package and set the
% maximum delimiter nesting depth for line breaks to~1:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \usepackage{breqn}
% \setkeys{breqn}{breakdepth={1}}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% See the discussion of environment options, Section~\vref{envopts}, for
% more information.
%
% Debugging information is no longer available as a package
% option. Instead, the tracing information has been added in a fashion
% so that it can be enabled as a docstrip option:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \generate{\file{breqn.sty}{\from{breqn.dtx}{package,trace}}}
% \end{verbatim}
% 
%
% \section{Environments and commands}
% \subsection{Environments}
% All of the following environments take an optional argument for
% applying local effects such as changing the typesize or adding a
% frame to an individual equation.
%
% \begin{description}
% \item[\env{dmath}] Like \env{equation} but supports line breaking and variant
% numbers.
%
% \item[\env{dmath*}] Unnumbered; like \env{displaymath} but supports line
% breaking
%
% \item[\env{dseries}] Like \env{equation} but starts out in text mode;
% intended for series of mathematical expressions of the form `A, B, and
% C'. As a special feature, if you use
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{math} ... \end{math}
% \end{verbatim}
% for each expression in the series, a suitable amount of inter-expression
% space will be automatically added. This is a small step in the direction of
% facilitating conversion of display math to inline math, and vice versa: If
% you write a display as
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dseries}
% \begin{math}A\end{math},
% \begin{math}B\end{math},
% and
% \begin{math}C\end{math}.
% \end{dseries}
% \end{verbatim}
% then conversion to inline form is simply a matter of removing the
% \verb'\begin{dseries}' and \verb'\end{dseries}' lines; the contents of the
% display need no alterations.
%
% It would be nice to provide the same feature for \verb'$' notation but
% there is no easy way to do that because the \verb'$' function has no
% entry point to allow changing what happens before math mode is entered.
% Making it work would therefore require turning \verb'$' into an active
% character, something that I hesitate to do in a \LaTeXe\ context.
%
% \item[\env{dseries*}] Unnumbered variant of \env{dseries}
%
% \item[\env{dgroup}] Like the \env{align} environment of \pkg{amsmath},
% but with each constituent equation wrapped in a \env{dmath},
% \env{dmath*}, \env{dseries}, or \env{dseries*} environment instead of being
% separated by \dbslash/. The equations are numbered with a group number.
% When the constituent environments are the numbered forms (\env{dmath} or
% \env{dseries}) they automatically switch to `subequations'-style
% numbering, i.e., something like (3a), (3b), (3c), \dots, depending on
% the current form of non-grouped equation numbers. See also
% \env{dgroup*}.
%
% \item[\env{dgroup*}] Unnumbered variant of \env{dgroup}. If the
% constituent environments are the numbered forms, they get normal
% individual equation numbers, i.e., something like (3), (4), (5), \dots~.
%
% \item[\env{darray}] Similar to \env{eqnarray} but with an argument like
% \env{array} for giving column specs. Automatic line breaking is not
% done here.
%
% \item[\env{darray*}] Unnumbered variant of \env{darray}, rather like
% \env{array} except in using \cs{displaystyle} for all column
% entries.
%
% \item[\env{dsuspend}] Suspend the current display in order to print
%   some text, without loss of the alignment. There is also a command
%   form of the same thing, \cs{intertext}. 
% \end{description}
%
% \subsection{Commands}
%
% The commands provided by \thepkg are:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\cs{condition}] This command is used for
% a part of a display which functions as a condition on the main
% assertion. For example:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}
% f(x)=\frac{1}{x} \condition{for $x\neq 0$}
% \end{dmath}.
% \end{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}
% f(x)=\frac{1}{x} \condition{for $x\neq 0$}
% \end{dmath}.
% The \cs{condition} command automatically switches to text mode (so that
% interword spaces function the way they should), puts in a comma, and
% adds an appropriate amount of space. To facilitate promotion\slash
% demotion of formulas, \cs{condition} \qq{does the right thing} if used
% outside of display math.
%
% To substitute a different punctuation mark instead of the default comma,
% supply it as an optional argument for the \cs{condition} command:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \condition[;]{...}
% \end{verbatim}
% (Thus, to get no punctuation: \verb'\condition[]{...}'.)
%
% For conditions that contain no text, you can use the starred form of the
% command, which means to stay in math mode:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}
% f(x)=\frac{1}{x} \condition*{x\neq 0}
% \end{dmath}.
%
% If your material contains a lot of conditions like these, you might like
% to define shorter abbreviations, e.g.,
% \begin{verbatim}
% \newcommand{\mc}{\condition*}% math condition
% \newcommand{\tc}{\condition}%  text condition
% \end{verbatim}
% But \thepkg refrains from predefining such abbreviations in order that
% they may be left to the individual author's taste.
%
% \item[\cs{hiderel}] In a compound equation it is sometimes desired to
% use a later relation symbol as the alignment point, rather than the
% first one. To do this, mark all the relation symbols up to the desired
% one with \cs{hiderel}:
% \begin{verbatim}
% T(n) \hiderel{\leq} T(2^n) \leq c(3^n - 2^n) ...
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{description}
%
% \section{Various environment options}\label{envopts}
%
% The following options are recognized for the \env{dmath}, \env{dgroup},
% \env{darray}, and \env{dseries} environments; some of the options do not
% make sense for all of the environments, but if an option is used where
% not applicable it is silently ignored rather than treated as an error.
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}[style={\small}]
% \begin{dmath}[number={BV}]
% \begin{dmath}[label={xyz}]
% \begin{dmath}[relindent={1em}]
% \begin{dmath}[compact]
% \begin{dmath}[spread={1pt}]
% \begin{dmath}[frame]
% \begin{dmath}[frame={1pt},framesep={2pt}]
% \begin{dmath}[background={red}]
% \begin{dmath}[color={purple}]
% \begin{dmath}[breakdepth={0}]
% \end{verbatim}
%
% Use the \opt{style} option to change the type size of an individual
% equation. This option can also serve as a catch-all option for
% altering the equation style in other ways; the contents are simply
% executed directly within the context of the equation.
%
% Use the \opt{number} option if you want the number for a particular
% equation to fall outside of the usual sequence. If this option is used
% the equation counter is not incremented. If for some reason you need to
% increment the counter and change the number at the same time, use the
% \opt{style} option in addition to the \opt{number} option:
% \begin{verbatim}
% style={\refstepcounter{equation}}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% Use of the normal \cs{label} command instead of the \opt{label} option
% works, I think, most of the time (untested).
%
% Use the \opt{relindent} option to specify something other than the
% default amount for the indention of relation symbols. The default is
% 2em.
%
% Use the \opt{compact} option in compound equations to inhibit line
% breaks at relation symbols. By default a line break will be taken before
% each relation symbol except the first one. With the \opt{compact} option
% \LaTeX\ will try to fit as much material as possible on each line, but
% breaks at relation symbols will still be preferred over breaks at binary
% operator symbols.
%
% Use the \opt{spread} option to increase (or decrease) the amount of
% interline space in an equation. See the example given above.
%
% Use the \opt{frame} option to produce a frame around the body of the
% equation. The thickness of the frame can optionally be specified by
% giving it as an argument of the option. The default thickness is
% \cs{fboxrule}.
%
% Use the \opt{framesep} option to change the amount of space separating
% the frame from what it encloses. The default space is \cs{fboxsep}.
%
% Use the \opt{background} option to produce a colored background for the
% equation body. The \pkg{breqn} package doesn't automatically load the
% \pkg{color} package, so this option won't work unless you remember
% to load the \pkg{color} package yourself.
%
% Use the \opt{color} option to specify a different color for the contents
% of the equation. Like the \opt{background} option, this doesn't work if
% you forgot to load the \pkg{color} package.
%
% Use the \opt{breakdepth} option to change the level of delimiter nesting
% to which line breaks are allowed. To prohibit line breaks within
% delimiters, set this to 0:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}[breakdepth={0}]
% \end{verbatim}
% The default value for breakdepth is 2. Even when breaks are allowed
% inside delimiters, they are marked as less desirable than breaks outside
% delimiters. Most of the time a break will not be taken within delimiters
% until the alternatives have been exhausted.
%
% Options for the \env{dgroup} environment: all of the above, and also
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dgroup}[noalign]
% \begin{dgroup}[brace]
% \end{verbatim}
%
% By default the equations in a \env{dgroup} are mutually aligned on their
% relation symbols ($=$, $<$, $\geq$, and the like). With the
% \opt{noalign} option each equation is placed individually without
% reference to the others.
%
% The \opt{brace} option means to place a large brace encompassing the
% whole group on the same side as the equation number.
%
% Options for the \env{darray} environment: all of the above (where
% sensible), and also
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{darray}[cols={lcr@{\hspace{2em}}lcr}]
% \end{verbatim}
% The value of the \opt{cols} option for the darray environment should be
% a series of column specs as for the \env{array} environment, with the
% following differences:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item For l, c, and r what you get is not text, but math, and
% displaystyle math at that. To get text you must use a 'p' column
% specifier, or put an \cs{mbox} in each of the individual cells.
%
% \item Vertical rules don't connect across lines.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \section{The \pkg{flexisym} package}\label{flexisym}
%
% The \pkg{flexisym} package does some radical changes in the setup for
% math symbols to allow their definitions to change dynamically throughout
% a document. The \pkg{breqn} package uses this to make symbols of classes
% 2, 3, 4, 5 run special functions inside an environment such as
% \env{dmath} that provide the necessary support for automatic line
% breaking.
%
% The method used to effect these changes is to change the definitions of
% \cs{DeclareMathSymbol} and \cs{DeclareMathDelimiter}, and then
% re-execute the standard set of \LaTeX\ math symbol definitions.
% Consequently, additional mathrel and mathbin symbols defined by other
% packages will get proper line-breaking behavior if the other package is
% loaded after the \pkg{flexisym} package and the symbols are defined
% through the standard interface.
%
%
%
% \section{Caution! Warning!}
% Things to keep in mind when writing documents with \thepkg:
% \begin{itemize}
%
% \item The notation $:=$ must be written with the command \cs{coloneq}.
%   Otherwise the $:$ and the $=$ will be treated as two separate relation
%   symbols with an \qq{empty RHS} between them, and they will be printed
%   on separate lines.
%
% \item Watch out for constructions like \verb'^+' where a single binary
% operator or binary relation symbol is subscripted or superscripted. When
% the \pkg{breqn} or \pkg{flexisym} package is used, braces are mandatory
% in such constructions: \verb'^{+}'. This applies for both display and
% in-line math.
%
% \item If you want \LaTeX\ to make intelligent decisions about line
% breaks when vert bars are involved, use proper pairing versions of the
% vert-bar symbols according to context: \verb'\lvert n\rvert' instead of
% \verb'|n|'. With the nondirectional \verb'|' there is no way for \LaTeX\
% to reliably deduce which potential breakpoints are inside delimiters
% (more highly discouraged) and which are not.
%
% \item If you use the \pkg{german} package or some other package that
% turns double quote \verb'"' into a special character, you may encounter
% some problems with named math symbols of type mathbin, mathrel,
% mathopen, or mathclose in moving arguments. For example, \cs{leq} in a
% section title will be written to the \fn{.aux} file as something like
% \verb'\mathchar "3214'. This situation probably ought to be improved,
% but for now use \cs{protect}.
%
% \item Watch out for the \texttt{[} character at the beginning of a
% \env{dmath} or similar environment, if it is supposed to be interpreted
% as mathematical content rather than the start of the environment's
% optional argument.
%
% This is OK:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}
% [\lambda,1]...
% \end{dmath}
% \end{verbatim}
% This will not work as expected:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{dmath}[\lambda,1]...\end{dmath}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \item Watch out for unpaired delimiter symbols (in display math only):
% \begin{verbatim}
% ( ) [ ] \langle \rangle \{ \} \lvert \rvert ...
% \end{verbatim}
% If an open delimiter is used without a close delimiter, or vice versa,
% it is normally harmless but may adversely affect line breaking. This is only
% for symbols that have a natural left or right directionality. Unpaired
% \cs{vert} and so on are fine.
%
% When a null delimiter is used as the other member of the pair
% (\verb'\left.' or \verb'\right.') this warning doesn't apply.
%
% \item If you inadvertently apply \cs{left} or \cs{right} to something
% that is not a delimiter, the error messages are likely to be a bit
% more confusing than usual. The normal \LaTeX\ response to an error such
% as
% \begin{verbatim}
% \left +
% \end{verbatim}
% is an immediate message
% \begin{verbatim}
% ! Missing delimiter (. inserted).
% \end{verbatim}
% When \thepkg is in use, \LaTeX\ will fail to realize anything is wrong
% until it hits the end of the math formula, or a closing delimiter
% without a matching opening delimiter, and then the first message is an
% apparently pointless
% \begin{verbatim}
% ! Missing \endgroup inserted.
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Introduction}
% The \pkg{breqn} package provides environments
% \env{dmath}, \env{dseries}, and \env{dgroup} for
% displayed equations with \emph{automatic line breaking},
% including automatic indention of relation symbols and binary operator
% symbols at the beginning of broken lines.    These environments
% automatically pull in following punctuation so that it can be written in
% a natural way.    The \pkg{breqn} package also provides a
% \env{darray} environment similar to the \env{array}
% environment but using \cs{displaystyle} for all the array cells and
% providing better interline spacing (because the vertical ruling
% feature of \env{array} is dropped).   
% These are all autonumbered environments like \env{equation}
% and have starred forms that don't add a number.    For a more
% comprehensive and detailed description of the features and intended
% usage of the \pkg{breqn} package see \fn{breqndoc.tex}.   
% 
% 
% 
% 
% \section{Strategy}
% Features of particular note are the ability to have
% linebreaks even within a \cs{left} \ndash  \cs{right} pair of
% delimiters, and the automatic alignment on relations and binary
% operators of a split equation.    To make \env{dmath} handle
% all this, we begin by setting the body of the equation in a special
% paragraph form with strategic line breaks whose purpose is not to
% produce line breaks in the final printed output but rather to mark
% significant points in the equation and give us entry points for
% unpacking \cn{left} \ndash  \cn{right} boxes.   
% After the initial typesetting, we take the resulting stack of line
% fragments and, working backward, splice them into a new, single-line
% paragraph; this will eventually be poured into a custom parshape, after
% we do some measuring to calculate what that parshape should be.   
% This streamlined horizontal list may contain embedded material
% from user commands intended to alter line breaks, horizontal alignment,
% and interline spacing; such material requires special handling.   
% 
% To make the `shortskip' possibility work even for
% multiline equations, we must plug in a dummy \tex  display to give us
% the value of \cs{predisplaysize}, and calculate for ourselves when
% to apply the short skips.   
% 
% In order to measure the equation body and do various
% enervating calculations on whether the equation number will fit and so
% on, we have to set it in a box.    Among other things, this means
% that we can't unhbox it inside \dbldollars  \dots  \dbldollars , or
% even \verb"$" \dots  \verb"$": \tex  doesn't allow you to
% \cs{unhbox} in math mode.    But we do want to unhbox it rather
% than just call \cs{box}, otherwise we can't take advantage of
% available shrink from \cs{medmuskip} to make equations shrink to
% fit in the available width.    So even for simple one-line equations
% we are forced to fake a whole display without going through \tex 's
% primitive display mechanism (except for using it to get
% \cs{predisplaysize} as mentioned above).   
% 
% 
% In the case of a framed equation body, the current implementation is
% to set the frame in a separate box, of width zero and height zero,
% pinned to the upper left corner of the equation body, and then print the
% equation body on top of it.   
% For attaching an equation number it would be much simpler to wrap
% the equation body in the frame and from then on treat the body as a
% single box instead of multiple line boxes.   
% But I had a notion that it might be possible some day to support
% vertical stretching of the frame.   
% 
%

% \section{Prelim}
%
% This package doesn't work with \latex  2.09, nor with other
% versions of \latex  earlier than 1994/12/01.

% \section{Package options}
% 
% Most options are set with the \cs{options} command (which
% calls \cs{setkeys}) because the standard package option
% mechanism doesn't provide support for key-value syntax.

% First we need to get the catcodes sorted out.

% The \pkg{flexisym} package makes it possible to attach
% extra actions to math symbols, in particular mathbin, mathrel, mathopen,
% and mathclose symbols.   
% Normally it would suffice to call \cs{RequirePackage} without
% any extra testing, but the nature of the package is such that it is
% likely to be called earlier with different (no) options.   
% Then is it really helpful to be always warning the user about
% \quoted{Incompatible Package Options!}?   
% I don't think so.

% The value of \cs{eqbinoffset} should include a negative shrink

% Here for the dimens, it would be advisable to do some more careful
% management to conserve dimen registers.    First of all, most of the
% dimen registers are needed in the measuring phase, which is a tightly
% contained step that happens after the contents of the equation have been
% typeset into a box and before any external functions have a chance to
% regain control\mdash  \eg , the output routine.   
% Therefore it is possible to make use of the the dimen registers 0--9,
% reserved by convention for scratch use, without fear of conflict with
% other macros.    But I don't want to use them directly with the
% available names:
% \begin{literalcode}
% \dimen@ \dimen@i \dimen@ii \dimen3 \dimen4 ... \dimen9
% \end{literalcode}
% .    It would be much more useful to have names for these registers
% indicative of way they are used.   
% 
% Another source whence dimen registers could be borrowed is the
% \pkg{amsmath} package, which allocates six registers for
% equation-measuring purposes.    We can reuse them under different
% names since the \pkg{amsmath} functions and our functions will
% never be used simultaneously.   
% \begin{literalcode}
% \eqnshift@ \alignsep@ \tagshift@ \tagwidth@ \totwidth@ \lineht@
% \end{literalcode}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newdimen\eq@dp         % Depth of last line

\newdimen\eq@wdT        % Total width for framing
\newdimen\eq@wdMin      % Width of narrowest line in equation
\newdimen\grp@wdL       % Max width of LHS's in a group
\newdimen\grp@wdR       % Max RHS of all equations in a group 
\newdimen\grp@wdT
\newdimen\eq@wdRmax

\newdimen\eq@indentstep % Indent amount when LHS is not present
\newdimen\eq@linewidth  % Width actually used for display
\newdimen\grp@linewidth % Max eq@linewidth over a group
%    \end{macrocode}
% Maybe \cs{eq@hshift} could share the same register as
% \cs{mathindent} [mjd,1997/10/22].   
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newdimen\eq@hshift

% Init \cs{eq@indentstep} to a nonzero value so that we can

% that is the right init before computing a min.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
\eq@indentstep=\maxdimen
\newdimen\eq@given@sidespace
%    \end{macrocode}

% 
% To initialize \cs{eqnumside} and \cs{eqindent} properly,
% we may need to grub around a bit in \cs{@filelist}.    However,
% if the \pkg{amsmath} package was used, we can use its option
% data.    More trouble: if a documentclass sends an option of
% \opt{leqno} to \pkg{amsmath} by default, and it gets
% overridden by the user with a \opt{reqno} documentclass option,
% then \pkg{amsmath} believes itself to have received
% \emph{both} options.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
\@ifpackagewith{amsmath}{leqno}{%
  \@ifpackagewith{amsmath}{reqno}{}{\def\eqnumside{L}}%
}{%
%    \end{macrocode}
% If the \pkg{amsmath} package was not used, the next
% method for testing the \opt{leqno} option is to see if
% \fn{leqno.clo} is present in \cs{@filelist}.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \def\@tempa#1,leqno.clo,#2#3\@nil{%
    \ifx @#2\relax\else \def\eqnumside{L}\fi
  }%
  \@xp\@tempa\@filelist,leqno.clo,@\@nil
%    \end{macrocode}
% Even that test may fail in the case of \cls{amsart} if it does
% not load \pkg{amsmath}.    Then we have to look whether
% \cs{iftagsleft@} is defined, and if so whether it is true.   
% This is tricky if you want to be careful about conditional nesting
% and don't want to put anything in the hash table unnecessarily.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \if L\eqnumside
  \else
    \@ifundefined{iftagsleft@}{}{%
      \edef\eqnumside{%
        \if TT\csname fi\endcsname\csname iftagsleft@\endcsname
          L\else R\fi
      }%
    }
  \fi
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% A similar sequence of tests handles the \quoted{fleqn or not fleqn}

% \section{Measuring equation components}
% Measure the left-hand side of an equation.    This
% function is called by mathrel symbols.    For the first mathrel we
% want to discourage a line break more than for following mathrels; so
% \cs{mark@lhs} gobbles the following \cs{rel@break} and
% substitutes a higher penalty.   
% \begin{aside}
% Maybe the LHS should be kept in a separate box.

% But the penalty for the first mathrel should still be lower than a
% binoppenalty.    If not, when the LHS contains a binop, the split
% will occur inside the LHS rather than at the mathrel.   
% On the other hand if we end up with a multline sort of equation
% layout where the RHS is very short, the break before the relation symbol
% should be made \emph{less} desirable than the breakpoints inside
% the LHS.   
% Since a lower penalty takes precedence over a higher one, we start
% by putting in the highest relpenalty; during subsequent measuring if we
% find that that RHS is not excessively short then we put in an extra
% \dquoted{normal} relpenalty when rejoining the LHS and RHS.

% penalty of $2$ put in with vadjust is a flag for
% \cs{eq@repack} to suggest that the box containing this line should
% be measured to find the value of \cs{eq@wdL}.    The
% second vadjust ensures that the normal prerelpenalty and thickmuskip
% will not get lost at the line break during this preliminary pass.

% \section{Special processing for end-of-equation}
% 
% At the end of a displayed equation environment we need to peek ahead
% for two things: following punction such as period or command that
% should be pulled in for inclusion at the end of the equation; and
% possibly also an \verb"\end{proof}" with an implied \dquoted{qed}
% symbol that is traditionally included at the end of the display rather
% than typeset on a separate line.   
% We could require that the users type \cs{qed} explicitly at the
% end of the display when they want to have the display take notice of it.   
% But the reason for doing that would only be to save work for the
% programmer; the most natural document markup would allow an inline
% equation and a displayed equation at the end of a proof to differ only
% in the environment name:
% \begin{literalcode}
% ... \begin{math} ... \end{math}.
% \end{proof}
% \end{literalcode}
% versus
% \begin{literalcode}
% ...
% \begin{dmath}
%  ...
% \end{dmath}.
% \end{proof}
% \end{literalcode}
% .   
% The technical difficulties involved in supporting this markup within
% \latex2e  are, admittedly, nontrivial.   
% Nonetheless, let's see how far we can go.   
% 
% 
% The variations that we will support are only the most
% straightforward ones:
% \begin{literalcode}
% \end{dmath}.
% \end{proof}
% \end{literalcode}
% or
% \begin{literalcode}
% \end{dmath}.
% Perhaps a comment
% \end{proof}
% \end{literalcode}
% .   
% If there is anything more complicated than a space after the
% period we will not attempt to scan any further for a possible
% \verb"\end{proof}".   
% This includes material such as:
% \begin{literalcode}
% \begin{figure}...\end{figure}%
% \footnote{...}
% \renewcommand{\foo}{...}
% \par
% \end{literalcode}
% or even a blank line\mdash because in \latex  a blank line is
% equivalent to \cs{par} and the meaning of \cs{par} is
% \dquoted{end-paragraph}; in my opinion if explicit end-of-paragraph
% markup is given before the end of an element, it has to be respected,
% and the preceding paragraph has to be fully finished off before
% proceeding further, even inside an element like \dquoted{proof} whose
% end-element formatting requires integration with the end of the
% paragraph text.   
% And \tex nically speaking, a \cs{par} token that comes from a
% blank line and one that comes from the sequence of characters
% \verb"\" \verb"p" \verb"a" \verb"r" are equally explicit.   
% I hope to add support for \cs{footnote} in the future, as it
% seems to be a legitimate markup possibility in that context from a
% purely logical point of view, but there are additional technical
% complications if one wants to handle it in full generality

% If an equation ends with a \cs{right} delim, the last thing
% on the math list will be a force-break penalty.    Then don't
% redundantly add another forcing penalty.    (question: when does a
% penalty after a linebreak not disappear?    Answer: when you have
% two forced break penalties in a row).    Ending punctuation, if
% any, goes into the last box with the mathoff kern.    If the math list
% ends with a slanted letter, then there will be an italic correction

% \subsection{Capturing the equation}
%
% BRM: There's a problem here (or with \cs{ss@scan}).  If the LHS has
% \cs{left} \cs{right} pairs, \ss@scan gets involved.  It seems to produce
% a separate box marked w/\cs{penalty} 3.  But it appears that \cs{eq@repack}
% is only expecting a single box for the LHS; when it measures that
% box it's missing the (typically larger) bracketted section,
% so the LHS is measured => 0pt (or very small).
%  I'm not entirely clear what Michael had in mind for this case;
% whether it's an oversight, or whether I've introduced some other bug.
% At any rate, my solution is to measure the RHS (accumulated in \cs{EQ@box}),
% at the time of the relation, and subtract that from the total size.

% equation into several lines is best examined in the light of an extreme
% example.    Suppose we have a two-column layout and a displayed
% equation falls inside a second-level list with nonzero leftmargin and
% rightmargin.    Then we want to try in succession a number of
% different possibilities.    In each case if the next possibility is
% no wider than the previous one, skip ahead to the one after.   
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item First try linewidth(2), the linewidth for the current
% level-2 list.   
% 
%  
% \item If we cannot find adequate linebreaks at that width, next try
% listwidth(2), the sum of leftmargin, linewidth, and rightmargin for
% the current list.   
% 
%  
% \item If we cannot find linebreaks at that width, next try linewidth
% (1) (skipping this step if it is no larger then
% listwidth(2)).   
% 
%  
% \item If we cannot find linebreaks at that width, next try
% listwidth(1).   
% 
%  
% \item If we cannot find linebreaks at that width, next try column
% width.   
% 
%  
% \item If we cannot find linebreaks at that width, next try text
% width.   
% 
%  
% \item If we cannot find linebreaks at that width, next try equation
% width, if it exceeds text width (\ie , if the style allows equations
% to extend into the margins).   
% 
%  
% \end{enumerate}

% \end{figure}
%
% At any given line width, we run through a series of parshape
% trials and, essentially, use the first one that gives decent line
% breaks.   
% But the process is a bit more complicated in fact.   
% In order to do a really good job of setting up the parshapes, we
% need to know how many lines the equation will require.   
% And of course the number of lines needed depends on the parshape!   
% So as our very first trial we run a simple first-approximation
% parshape (Figure~\vref{f:parshape-1}) whose
% main purpose is to get an estimate on the number of lines that will be
% needed; it chooses a uniform indent for all lines after the first one
% and does not take any account of the equation number.   
% A substantial majority of equations only require one line anyway,
% and for them this first trial will succeed.   
% In the one-line case if there is an equation number and it doesn't
% fit on the same line as the equation body, we don't go on to other
% trials because breaking up the equation body will not gain us
% anything\mdash we know that we'll have to use two lines in any case
% \mdash  so we might as well keep the equation body together on one line
% and shift the number to a separate line.   
% 
% If we learn from the first trial that the equation body
% requires more than one line, the next parshape trial involves adjusting
% the previous parshape to leave room for the equation number, if
% present.    If no number is present, again no further trials are
% needed.   
% 
% Some remarks about parshape handling.    The \tex 
% primitive doesn't store the line specs anywhere, \verb"\the\parshape"
% only returns the number of line specs.    This makes it well nigh
% impossible for different packages that use \cs{parshape} to work
% together.    Not that it would be terribly easy for the package
% authors to make inter-package collaboration work, if it were
% possible.    If we optimistically conjecture that
% someone some day may take on such a task, then the thing to do,
% obviously, is provide a parshape interface that includes a record of all
% the line specs.    For that we designate a macro \cs{@parshape}
% which includes not only the line specs, but also the line count and even
% the leading \cs{parshape} token.   
% This allows it to be directly executed without an auxiliary if-empty
% test.    It should include a trailing \cs{relax} when it has a
% nonempty value.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\@parshape\@empty
%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% 
% The function \cs{eq@measure} runs line-breaking trials
% on the copy of the equation body that is stored in the box register
% \cs{EQ@copy}, trying various possible layouts in order of
% preference until we get successful line breaks, where \quoted{successful}
% means there were no overfull lines.    The result of the trials is,
% first, a parshape spec that can be used for typesetting the real
% equation body in \cs{EQ@box}, and second, some information that
% depends on the line breaks such as the depth of the last line, the
% height of the first line, and positioning information for the equation
% number.   The two main variables in the equation layout are the line
% width and the placement of the equation number, if one is present.   
% 
% 
% \begin{macro}{\eq@measure}
% Run linebreak trials on the equation contents and measure the
% results.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\eq@measure{%
%    \end{macrocode}

% it.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \ifdim\eq@indentstep=\maxdimen \eq@indentstep\eqindentstep \fi
%    \end{macrocode}
% If \cs{eq@linewidth} is nonzero at this point, it means that
% the user specified a particular target width for this equation.   
% In that case we override the normal list of trial widths.   
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \ifdim\eq@linewidth=\z@ \else \edef\eq@linewidths{{\the\eq@linewidth}}\fi
  \begingroup \eq@params
  \leftskip\z@skip 
%    \end{macrocode}
% Even if \cs{hfuzz} is greater than zero a box whose contents
% exceed the target width by less then hfuzz still has a reported badness
% value of 1000000 (infinitely bad).    Because we use inf-bad
% to test whether a particular trial succeeds or fails, we want to make
% such boxes return a smaller badness.    To this end we include an
% \cs{hfuzz} allowance in \cs{rightskip}.    In fact,
% \cs{eq@params} ensures that \cs{hfuzz} for equations is at
% least 1pt.

% \section{Equation layout options}
% Using the notation C centered, I indented (applied to
% the equation body), T top, B bottom, M
% middle, L left, R right (applied to the equation number),
% the commonly used equation types are C, CRM, CRB, CLM, CLT,
% I, IRM, IRB, ILM, ILT.    In other words, CLM stands for Centered equation
% body with Left-hand Middle-placed equation number, and IRB stands for
% Indented equation with Right-hand Bottom-placed equation number.   
%
% Here are some general thoughts on how to place an equation
% tag. Currently it does not work as desired: the L option positions
% the tag app. 10 lines below the math expression, the RM doesn't
% position the tag on the baseline for single-line math
% expressions. Therefore I am going to first write what I think is
% supposed to happen and then implement it. 
%
% Below is a small list where especially the two three specifications
% should be quite obvious, I just don't want to forget anything and it
% is important to the implementation.
% \begin{description}
% \item[Definition 1] If a display consists of exactly one line, the
%   tag should always be placed on the same baseline as the math
%   expression.
% \end{description}
% The remaining comments refer to multi-line displays.
% \begin{description}
% \item[Definition 2] If a tag is to be positioned at the top (T), it
%   should be placed such that the baseline of the tag aligns with the
%   baseline of the top line of the display.
%
% \item[Definition 3] If a tag is to be positioned at the bottom (B),
%   it should be placed such that the baseline of the tag aligns with
%   the baseline of the bottom line of the display.
%
% \item[Definition 4] If a tag is to be positioned vertically centered
%   (M), it should be placed such that the baseline of the tag is
%   positioned exactly halfway between the baseline of the top line of
%   the display and the baseline of the bottom line of the display.
% \end{description}
% 
% Definitions 1--3 are almost axiomatic in their
% simplicity. Definition~4 is different because I saw at least two
% possibilities for which area to span:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Calculate distance from top of top line to the bottom of the
%   bottom line, position the vertical center of the tag exactly
%   halfway between those two extremes.
% 
% \item Calculate the distance from the baseline of the top line to
%   the baseline of the bottom line, position the baseline of the tag
%   exactly halfway between these two extremes.
% \end{itemize}
% Additional combinations of these methods are possible but make
% little sense in my opinion. I have two reasons for choosing the
% latter of these possibilities: Firstly, two expressions looking
% completely identical with the exception of a superscript in the
% first line or a subscript in the last line will have the tag
% positioned identically. Secondly, then M means halfway between T and
% B positions which makes good sense and then also automatically
% fulfills Definition~1.
%
% From an implementation perspective, these definitions should also
% make it possible to fix a deficiency in the current implementation,
% namely that the tag does not influence the height of a display, even
% if the display is a single line. This means that two single-line
% expressions in a \env{dgroup} can be closer together than
% \cs{intereqskip} if the math expressions are (vertically) smaller
% than the tag.

% \section{Delimiter handling}
% The special handling of delimiters is rather complex, but
% everything is driven by two motives: to mark line breaks inside
% delimiters as less desirable than line breaks elsewhere, and to make it
% possible to break open left-right boxes so that line breaks between
% \cs{left} and \cs{right} delimiters are not absolutely
% prohibited.    To control the extent to which line breaks will be
% allowed inside delimiters, set \cs{eqbreakdepth} to the maximum
% nesting depth.    Depth 0 means never break inside delimiters.   
% 
% Note: \cs{eqbreakdepth} is not implemented as a \latex 
% counter because changes done by \cs{setcounter} \etc  are always
% global.   
% 
% It would be natural to use grouping in the implementation
% \mdash  at an open delimiter, start a group and increase mathbin
% penalties; at a close delimiter, close the group.    But this gives us
% trouble in situations like the \env{array} environment, where a
% close delimiter might fall in a different cell of the \cs{halign}
% than the open delimiter.    
% Ok then, here's what we want the various possibilities to
% expand to.    Note that \cs{right} and \cs{biggr} are
% being unnaturally applied to a naturally open-type delimiter.   
% \begin{literalcode}
% ( -> \delimiter"4... \after@open

% The right delimiter is symmetrical top to bottom.   
% 
%  
% \item There is an upper limit on the size of the adjustment.   
% 
%  
% \item When we have a superscript, the amount of left-skew that we

% depending on the shape of the delimiter symbol.

% \section{Equation groups}
% For many equation groups the strategy is easy: just center each
% equation individually following the normal rules for a single
% equation.    In some groups, each equation gets its own number; in
% others, a single number applies to the whole group (and may need to be
% vertically centered on the height of the group).    In still other
% groups, the equations share a parent number but get individual equation
% numbers consisting of parent number plus a letter.   
% 
% If the main relation symbols in a group of equations are to be
% aligned, then the final alignment computations cannot be done until the
% end of the group \mdash  \ie , the horizontal positioning of the first
% $n - 1$ equations cannot be done immediately.    Yet because of
% the automatic line breaking, we cannot calculate an initial value of
% RHS-max over the whole group unless we do a trial run on each equation
% first to find an RHS-max for that equation.    Once we know RHS-group-max
% and LHS-group-max we must redo the trial set of each equation because
% they may affect the line breaks.    If the second trial for an
% equation fails (one of its lines exceeds the available width), but
% the first one succeeded, fall back to the first trial, \ie  let that
% equation fall out of alignment with the rest of the group.   
% 
% 
% All right then, here is the general idea of the whole algorithm for
% group alignment.   
% To start with, ignore the possibility of equation numbers so that
% our equation group has the form:
% \begin{literalcode}
% LHS[1] RHS[1,1] RHS[1,2] ... RHS[1,n[1]]
% LHS[2] RHS[2,1] RHS[2,2] ... RHS[2,n[2]]
%   ...
% LHS[3] RHS[3,1] RHS[3,2] ... RHS[3,n[3]]
% \end{literalcode}
% The number of RHS's might not be the same for all of the
% equations.   
% First, accumulate all of the equation contents in a queue, checking
% along the way to find the maximum width of all the LHS's and the maximum
% width of all the RHS's.   
% Call these widths maxwd\_L and maxwd\_R.   
% Clearly if maxwd\_L + maxwd\_R is less than or equal to the available
% equation width then aligning all of the equations is going to be simple.   
% 
% 
% Otherwise we are going to have to break at least one of the RHS's
% and/or at least one of the LHS's.   
% The first thing to try is using maxwd\_L for the LHS's and breaking
% all the RHS's as needed to fit in the remaining space.   
% However, this might be a really dumb strategy if one or more of the
% LHS's is extraordinarily wide.   
% So before trying that we check whether maxwd\_L exceeds some
% threshold width beyond which it would be unsensible not to break the LHS.   
% Such as, max(one-third of the available width; six ems), or
% something like that.   
% Or how about this?   
% Compare the average LHS width and RHS width and divide up the available
% width in the same ratio for line breaking purposes.   
% 
%
% BRM: Fairly broad changes; it mostly didn't work before (for me).
%
% \begin{description}
% \item[\cs{begin}\csarg{dgroup} produces a `numbered' group]
%   The number is the next equation number.
%   There are 2 cases:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item If ANY contained equations are numbered (|\begin{dmath}|), 
%       then they will be subnumbered: eg 1.1a
%       and the group number is not otherwise displayed.
% \item If ALL contained equations are unnumbered (|\begin{dmath*}|)
%       then the group, as a whole, gets a number displayed,
%       using the same number placement as for equations.
% \end{itemize}
% \item[\cs{begin}\csarg{dgroup*} produces an unnumbered group.]
%    Contained equations are numbered, or not, as normal.
%    But note that in the mixed case, it's too late to
%    force the unnumbered eqns to \cs{retry@with@number}
%    We'll just do a simple check of dimensions, after the fact,
%    and force a shiftnumber if we're stuck.
%
% NOTE: Does this work for dseries, as well? (alignment?)
%
% NOTE: Does \cs{label} attach to the expected thing?
%
% \item[For number placement] We use shiftnumber placement on ALL equations
%    if ANY equations need it, or if an unnumbered equation is too 
%    wide to be aligned, given that the group or other eqns are numbered.
%    [does this latter case interract with the chosen alignment?]
%
% \item[For Alignment]
%   As currently coded, it tries to align on relations, by default.
%   If LHS's are not all present, or too long, it switches to left-justify.
%   Maybe there are other cases that should switch?
%   Should there be a case for centered?
%
% NOTE: Should there be some options to choose alignment?

% \section{The \env{darray} environment}
% There are two potential applications for darray.    One
% is like eqnarray where the natural structure of the material crosses the
% table cell boundaries, and math operator spacing needs to be preserved
% across cell boundaries.    And there is also the feature of
% attaching an equation number to each row.    The other application
% is like a regular array but with automatic displaystyle math in each
% cell and better interline spacing to accommodate outsize cell
% contents.    In this case it is difficult to keep the vert ruling
% capabilities of the standard \env{array} environment without
% redoing the implementation along the lines of Arseneau's
% \pkg{tabls} package.    Because the vert ruling feature is at
% cross purposes with the feature of allowing interline stretch and page
% breaks within a multiline array of equations, the \env{darray}
% environment is targeted primarily as an alternative to
% \env{eqnarray}, and does not support vertical ruling.   
% 
% Overall strategy for \env{darray} is to use
% \cs{halign} for the body.    In the case of a group, use a
% single halign for the whole group!   
% \begin{aside}
% What about intertext?   
% \end{aside}
% 
% That's the most reliable way
% to get accurate column widths.    Don't spread the halign to the
% column width, just use the natural width.    Then, if we repack the
% contents of the halign into \cs{EQ@box} and \cs{EQ@copy}, as
% done for dmath, and twiddle a bit with the widths of the first and last
% cell in each row, we can use the same algorithms for centering and
% equation number placement as dmath!    As well as handling footnotes
% and vadjust objects the same way.   
% 
% We can't just use \cs{arraycolsep} for \env{darray}, if
% we want to be able to change it without screwing up interior arrays.   
% So let's make a new colsep variable.    The initial value is
% \quoted{2em, but let it shrink if necessary}.

\newskip\darraycolsep \darraycolsep 20pt plus1fil minus12pt

% \item 
% Make \verb":=" trigger a warning about using \cs{coloneq}
% instead.   
%  
% \item Ill-centered multiline equation (three-line case) in
% test008.   
%  
% \item Attaching a single group number.   
% 
%  
% \item 
% Make sure to dump out box registers after done using them.   
%  
% \item Do the implementation for \cs{eq@resume@parshape}.   
% 
%  
% \item Check on stackrel and buildrel and relbar and ???.   
% 
%  
% \item Test math symbols at the beginning of array cells.   
%  
% \item Test \dbslash  cmd in and out of delims.   
%  
% \item Framing the equation body: the parshape and number placement
% need adjusting when a frame is present.   
% 
%  
% \item Cascading line widths in list env.   
% 
%  
% \item Noalign option for dmath = multline arrangement?   
% 
%  
% \item Nocompact option, suggested 1998/05/19 by Andrew
% Swann.   
% 
%  
% \item \cs{delbreak} cmd to add discretionary space at a break
% within delimiters.   
% 
%  
% \item Reduce above/below skip when the number is shifted.   
% 
%  
% \item Need a \cs{middelim} command for marking a delimiter symbol
% as nondirectional if it has an innate directionality \verb"()[]" \etc .   
% 
%  
% \item 
% \cs{xrightarrow} from amsmath won't participate in line
% breaking unless something extra is done.   
% Make \cs{BreakingRel} and \cs{BreakingBin} functions?   
%  
% \item Placement of number in an indented quotation or
% abstract.   
%  
% \item If $LHSwd > 2em$, it might be a good idea to try with
% eq@indentstep = 2em before shifting the number.    Currently this
% doesn't happen if the first trial pass (without the number)
% succeeds with $indentstep = LHSwd > 2em$.   
% 
%  
% \item Read past \verb"\end{enumerate}" when checking
% for \verb"\end{proof}"?   
%  
% \item 
% Look into using a \dquoted{qed-list} of environment names instead of
% checking the existence of \cs{proofqed}.   
%  
% \item Pick up the vadjust\slash footnote\slash mark handling.   
% 
%  
% \item Forcing\slash prohibiting page breaks after\slash before
% an equation.   
% 
%  
% \item Adding a spanner brace on the left and individual numbers on
% the right (indy-numbered cases).   
% 
%  
% \item Provide \cs{shiftnumber}, \cs{holdnumber} to
% override the decision.   
%  
% \item  Provide a mechanism for adjusting the vertical position of
% the number.    Here a version-specific selection macro would be
% useful.   
% \begin{literalcode}
% \begin{dmath}[
%   style={\foredition{1}{\raisenumber{13pt}}}
% ]
% \end{literalcode}
% 
%  
% \item 
% Add an alignleft option for an equation group to mean, break and
% align to a ladder layout as usual within the equations, but for the
% group alignment used the leftmost point (for equations that don't
% have an LHS, this makes no difference).   
%  
% \item 
% Test with Arseneau's wrapfig for parshape\slash everypar
% interaction.   
% 
%  
% \item Fix up the macro/def elements.   
%  
% \item Convert the literal examples in section \quoted{Equation types and
% forms} to typeset form.   
% 
%  
% \item Compile comparison-examples: \eg , a standard equation
% env with big left-right objects that don't shrink, versus how shrinking
% can allow it to fit.   
% 
%  
% \item Frame the \dquoted{figures} since they are mostly
% text.   
%  
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% 
% 
% Possible enhancements:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Provide a \opt{pull} option meaning to pull the first
% and last lines out to the margin, like the \env{multline}
% environment of the \pkg{amsmath} package.    Maybe this should
% get an optional argument, actually, to specify the amount of space left
% at the margin.   
%  
% \item With the draft option, one would like to see the equation
% labels in the left margin.    Need to check with the
% \pkg{showkeys} package.   
% 
%  
% \item Options for break preferences: if there's not enough room, do
% we first shift the number, or first try to break up the equation
% body?.    In an aligned group, does sticking to the group alignment
% take precedence over minimizing the number of line breaks needed for
% individual equations?.    And the general preferences probably need
% to be overridable for individual instances.   
%  
% \item Extend suppress-breaks-inside-delimiters support to inline
% math (suggestion of Michael Doob).   
%  
% \item Use belowdisplayshortskip above a dsuspend fragment if the
% fragment is only one line and short enough compared to the equation line
% above it.   
% 
%  
% \item Add \cs{eqfuzz} distinct from \cs{hfuzz}.   
% Make use of it in the measuring phase.   
% 
%  
% \item Provision for putting in a \quoted{continued} note.   
%  
% \item Conserve box mem: modify frac, sub, sup, overline, underline,
% sqrt, to turn off \cs{bin@break} and (less urgently)
% \cs{rel@break}.   
% 
%  
% \item More explicit support for Russian typesetting conventions (cf
% Grinchuk article).   
% 
%  
% \item With package option \opt{refnumbers},
% leave unnumbered all uncited equations, even if they are not done with
% the star form (Bertolazzi's easyeqn idea).   
%  
% \item In an equation group, use a vertical bracket with the
% equation number to mark the lines contained in that equation.   
% 
%  
% \item For a two-line multline thingamabob, try to
% make sure that the lines overlap in the middle by 2 em or whatever
% (settable design variable).   
%  
% \item Provide a separate vertical column for the principal mathrel
% symbols and center them within the column if they aren't all the same
% width.    Maybe an option for \env{dmath}: relwidth=x, so that two
% passes are not required to get the max width of all the mathrels.   
% Or, no, just require it to be an halign or provide a macro to be
% applied to all the shorter rels:
% \begin{literalcode}
% lhs \widerel{19pt}{=} ...
%     \xrightarrow{foo} ...
% \end{literalcode}
% 
%  
% \item try to use vadjust for keepglue
%  
% \end{enumerate}
