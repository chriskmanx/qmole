0.4.1 to 0.4.2
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add question of emacs hotkey and answer in FAQ.
	add option to load application icon, not implemented yet.
	fix display problem when both bottomTabbar and hideTabbar are
		enabled (Sourceforge Bug ID 1299309).
	fix signal sent to child process when quit a page. We now send
		SIGHUP instead of SIGKILL to be more graceful.
	fix compile error on OpenBSD 3.7.
	fix missing iconv library on OpenBSD 3.7.
	fix prematurely stop of tab title sequences on ^C. Thanks to
		Johann 'Myrrkraverk' for the report and patch [Sourceforge
		Bug ID 1211691]. If any of you dislike the patch, please
		blame Johann instead of me. ;-)
	fix default 256 colors. When XTERM_COLORS is defined, we use the
		same colors as xterm. Thanks to Gautam Iyer for the patch.
	fix trailing space in selection by porting Marius Gedminas's
		patch for rxvt - we will not copy trailing space in mouse
		selection. Thanks to Mun Johl for pointing me the patch.
	fix 64-bit bugs reported on debian
	fix default maximal number of tabs to 15.
	fix configure.ac. Revert back the LINUX_KEYS check (disable it)
		since it causes lots of complaints. :p  I think LINUX_KEYS
		mean to use Home/End keys as Linux console. But X terminals
		like mrxvt are different.
	add a new configurable X resource for Linux console style Home/End
		keys instead of fixing it in the source code.
	fix rxvt_process_hotkey interface, simplify it by eliminating the
		three mask variables.
	fix escape sequence of F1 - F4. Now we introduce a *magic* check
		to determine the terminal type at run-time and send correct
		escape sequence accordingly. To support this feature, we also
		introduce a new escape sequence to let user tell mrxvt that
		terminal type has changed at run-time. To be clear, normally
		user changes the TERM environment variable in shell. However,
		this change is not visible to mrxvt! So the user must tell
		mrxvt that the TERM environment variable has been changed using
		this new escape sequence. Thanks to Johann Oskarsson for the
		report and patch.


0.4.0 to 0.4.1
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add mrxvt.spec file based on Jingyu Zhou's work. This file is used
		to build RPM packages.
	fix Korea encoding according to rxvt sourceforge bug id 1181825.
	fix tinting on Window Manager other than WindowMaker.
	fix dead key support. Add a hack to enable dead key manually. User
		must press dead key twice or press dead key and space to input
		the characters of dead keys themselves. This is a temporary
		solution. It may be changed in future release. To enable this
		feature, define USE_DEADKEY in feature.h. Thanks to wwp for
		all the help on this issue.
	fix infinite loop on Solaris when a child exists. Thanks to Sunil
		for the patch.
	fix cursor color is rendition color by applying William P. Y.
		Hadisoeseno's patch. But disable it in feature.h by default.
	fix FAQ of Home/End key question.
	fix malloc function check in configure.ac, and apply a patch to
		rxvt_malloc when the size is 0. On Tru64/OSF, malloc(0) returns
		NULL pointer. We want to avoid this behavior. Thanks to Teun
		Burger.
	fix crash when saveLines exceeds 65535, hopefully.
	fix help message. Print it to stdout instead of stderr.
	fix lots of compile warnings, thanks to Teun Burger for the report.
	fix compile problems on Tru64/OSF based on Teun Burger's patch.
	fix manpage of hotkey inhibit options.
	fix manpage of special hotkey symbols.
	fix freezing with mc in bash when viewing a file in tar files. This
		is because the read syscall blocks when trying to read more
		data from the child process. Strange problem since it seems 
		good in tcsh. [Sourceforge Bug ID: 1103548]


0.3.13 to 0.4.0
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add option tabShell in order to execute shell before running tab
		command in the tab. Thus the tab will not quit if the tab
		command exits.
	fix definition of macro LINUX_KEYS based on luohui's suggestion.
		We define the LINUX_KEYS macro if the OS probed by the 
		configure script is Linux. Thus, we can use Home/End key to
		reach the beginning/end of a command line. (But it seems not
		effective on my system :-()
	fix option and resources for tab sessions. Now we change them to
		tab commands to avoid confusion with X session. Notice that
		all resource names and command line options related to each
		tab have been changed! In particular, follow these:
			mrxvt*vt%d.session -> mrxvt*vt%d.command
			mrxvt*cmdAllSession -> mrxvt*cmdAllTabs
			mrxvt*initSession -> mrxvt*cmdInitTabs
			-vt%d.ss -> -vt%d.e
			-cs -> -at
			-is -> -it
	fix question about synchronizing tab title to current directory
		for C shell in FAQ based on Nicholas Carrasco's solution.
	fix default terminal type in configure script. Change it from rxvt
		to xterm to avoid wired bash behavior for very long command
		line. Thanks to Luohui for the report and digging out the
		solution.
	fix core dump if the child process quits too fast. In this case,
		read syscall returns -1, but we didn't handle it carefully
		and moved cmdbuf_endp backward!
	fix typo and man page for key bindings according to Elan Ruusamae's
		suggestion.
	fix off-by-one byte buffer overflow when parsing the X resources
		using XrmGetResource [Sourceforge Bug ID: 1117722].


0.3.12 to 0.3.13
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add configure option --enable-minimal to only enable minimal
		number of configuration options. So people who want a slim
		mrxvt can simply their configuration command line.
	add escape sequence to change bgfade degree at runtime.
	fix xdefaults.c. Merge Grant McDorman's patch that correctly
		handles the vt%d.BlahBlah resources. Many thanks to Grant!
	fix input buffer filling case. It means that there is space in
		the beginning of the input buffer, but no space at the end
		of the input buffer. In this case, we can move the content
		of the input buffer forward to free space.
	fix input buffer overrun in rxvt_cmd_getc. The input buffer size
		should be (BUFSIZ-1 - (cmdbuf_endp - cmdbuf_base)) instead of
		BUFSIZ!!! Thanks to Carsten Menke for reporting the bug.
	fix the missing -sm option in session management restart command.
	fix compile error of xfticonv if iconv.h is not found. This seems
		to be a common problem on Cygwin for some Chinese users. So
		if your mrxvt can display CJK text using X11 fonts, but not
		XFT fonts, check whether HAVE_ICONV_H is defined in config.h
		when you compile mrxvt!
	fix tab number when saving terminal status in session management.
		Ooooops, we miss the first tab whose index is zero!!!
	fix leakage of the highest file descriptor to child process. In
		the past, this can be considered as a potential security bug.
		But, only in theory... :p
	fix tab moving behavior when move first tab to left or last tab
		to right. Disable the moving in these two cases because they
		are too complicated to code correctly. :p [Sourceforge bug id
		1107773]
	fix behavior of xterm escape sequence of setting terminal window
		title. We also set the current tab's title so that if the user
		"set titlestring=%f" in ~/.vimrc, the current tab's title is
		set to the opened file as well. I have found it very useful
		to browse among multiple tabs that have different files
		opened. If you do not like this behavior, uncomment the macro
		SET_TAB_TITLE_ON_XTERM_SEQUENCE in feature.h.
	fix behavior of xterm escape sequence of setting terminal window
		title. We introduce a new macro SET_TAB_TITLE_NOT_WIN_TITLE
		to avoid setting window title at all. This is used to help
		vim since vim restores the window title using old window
		title when it exits. This can be annoying - try it and you
		know the reason. If you do not like it, uncomment the macro
		in feature.h.
	fix poor response speed of the active tab if there are busy
		activities in the inactive tabs. Now in rxvt_cmd_getc, we
		first try to return the active tab if it contains input data.
		If there is no input data in the active tab, we process the X
		events to see if they can push input data into the active tab.
		If still not, we return other tab that contain input data. If
		all tabs have no input data, we select on all tabs and then
		pick a tab to return. This is a major fix that delays our
		0.4.0 release. But hey, we want a stable 0.4.0, right?!
	fix tab lockup. It happenes when a tab is particular busy, thus
		the tabs on the right side of this tab are locked up.
	fix configure script: fix check of the utempter, xpm, jpeg and
		png options, fix default option of mouse slip wheel and
		ttygid.
	fix pseudo-transparency when opacity is not enabled.
	fix compile error when utmp is disabled.
	fix manpage for the description of %d.


0.3.11 to 0.3.12
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add option to enable/disable X session management, compatible to
		Xterm.
	add hotkey function CopySel and PasteSel to copy and paste
		selection. The CopySel function is used to copy the selection 
		in current terminal to the X clipboard, but it is not yet
		implemented. The PasteSel function is used to past the 
		selection in current terminal or the X clipboard into the
		terminal. It is working now. But be careful that define it
		as Ctrl_v may break something! For example, in vi, you might
		want to replace the character ^M, which requires you to type
		in Ctrl_v and Ctrl_m.
	add meta key Primary so that a hotkey can be disabled when the
		terminal is using the secondary screen. This is useful for
		the above problem (Ctrl_v).
	fix X properties, merge them into global Atom array r->h->xa[].
	fix setting terminal window title. Now we support UTF-8 terminal
		titles, which makes it work when we use multichar strings as
		terminal title.
	fix half shadow configuration option, show its value only when
		rxvt scrollbar is enabled.
	fix help message for modes, make them consistent.
	fix resource name in man page. Replace XTerm.ResourceName with
		mrxvt.resourceName to avoid confusion.
	fix resource name of backspace key, delete key, selection style,
		and print pipe. Standardize them as other resource names.
		This will break old rxvt style resource names, but cause
		less confusion.
	fix random bold text under XFT. We disable the bold XFT font in
		order to fix it. This should be a temporary solution.
	fix rxvt_clean_exit. Kill all child processes there since zsh
		puts them into background if we do not do so. Thanks to
		Rob Eberts for the patch.
	fix slow scrolling when XFT antialiasing is enabled. We just
		disable screen refresh at all on scrolling. Now scrolling is
		super fast, e.g., takes about one second to `ls -l /usr/bin'.
		I guess it probably is the fastest in the world.  But there
		is no visual effect of scrolling any more. There is not a
		perfect world, right? :p
	fix poor performance of mouse wheel scrolling when XFT antialiasing
		is enabled. Basically, we just disable screen refresh on
		scrolling. Thanks to Jacques Bouchard for the report.
	fix missing mouse wheel scrolling macros in feature.h.
	fix compile error when mouse wheel is defined.
	fix meta8 and mouseWheelScrollPage option. Now they can be enabled
		by command line options.
	fix cutChars resource and its man page option. Thanks to Ashish
		for the report. 
	fix scrollTtyOutputInhibit man page option. Thanks to Ashish
		for the bug report.
	fix missing parameter when calling rxvt_scr_move_to under
		SCROLL_ON_HOMEEND_KEYS feature. Thanks to Ashish for the
		report.
	fix rxvt_get_pty. Avoid potential compile error for C compilers.
	fix mrxvtset.pl. Replace the control character (^[) with its
		digital forms to avoid the side effect if a user accidently
		cats the script in shell.
	fix configure.ac. Non-GNU C compilers like SUN's cannot accept
		-Wall and -fPIC options.
	fix rxvt_init_hotkeys. Use ANSI_C compliant function instead of
		GCC extension. Thanks to Grant McDorman for the patch.
	fix Cqual qualifiers, non-gcc compilers do not support it. Thanks
		to Grant McDorman for reporting this issue.
	fix possible integer overflow in throttle bell. Also comment out
		this feature in the feature.h.
	fix crash on XftPatternDestroy if we change the font size in
		reverse order, e.g., increase the font size then decrease
		it. It seems that we should not destroy the pattern returned
		by XftFontMatch. But there is no documentation to explain it
		clearly! :-(
	fix rxvt_save_options. Do not save undocumented features :p
	fix keyboard deadlock when Shift_Home (increasing font) is pressed,
		and XIM is enabled, but XIM is not successfully opened. This
		is because the same keyboard events are filtered away by
		rxvt_cmd_getc.
	fix button pixmaps. Narrow the width of the pixmaps so that it
		is the same as the height.
	fix iso8859 fonts. We will only use iso8859-1 fonts as default
		fonts.
	fix multichar encoding routine. Since we set the default encoding
		method (MULTICHAR_ENCODING) in config.h anyway, there is no
		need to *guess* the encoding method from locale if user has
		not supplied it in command line option or X resources. Now
		the encoding routine should be much more clear and simple.
	fix multichar encoding list.
	fix session restart style, pw init value and callback functions.
	fix session restart parameters.
	fix man page for the mfont resource case problem.
	fix compile error because the const definition of ttydev.
	fix configure script for the missing check of limits.h. It is
		required on cygwin.
	fix xdefaults-sample.txt, giving example to disable tricky hotkeys
		that are used by emacs.
	fix drawing button frame. Now the buttons should seem more pretty.
	fix shortcut key bindings of Shift_Home and Shift_End.
	fix rxvt_hotkey_save_config. If HOME environment variable is not
		defined, do not call rxvt_save_config.
	fix rxvt_Exit_signal, call rxvt_clean_exit directly instead of
		sending the signal again to the default signal handler. They
		should have the same effect, but the fix may avoid hanging
		the terminal.


0.3.10 to 0.3.11
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add Avi Yagodnick's perl script to print escape sequence for
		manipulating mrxvt runtime behavior. So users need not to
		compile the sample settitle.c any more if they have a perl
		interpreter.
	add command line option -ddh to avoid loading default hotkeys.
	add escape sequence to toggle hotkeys.
	add option disableHotkeys to disable hotkeys.
	add option confFileSave and hotkey to save the configuration of
		current running mrxvt process.
	fix default jumpScroll threshold. Increase it to 4 in order to
		get better scrolling performance.
	fix veryBold font option. Use veryBold font by default because of
		the panic screams from the users. ;-)
	fix plain scrollbar residual pixels under transparency. Thanks to
		Matthieu Serrano for the bug report!
	fix off-focus fading wired behavior. It is because the foreground
		and background color of GC is not updated in the function
		rxvt_set_bg_focused. Therefore, the following text is drawn
		using the old color till a color change happens later.
	fix X session management crash.
	fix file descriptors leak to the child processes.
	fix mrxvt hangs on zsh if session management is enabled: we need
		to prevent the file descriptor opened by session manager from
		being leaked to the child processes. And there is a race
		condition when we handle the ICE file descriptor while the
		terminal exits.
	fix broken configure options (oooops! nobody has reported these
		problems ;-).
	fix compile error when tinting is disabled but fading is enabled.
	fix scrollTtyOutputInhibit.
	fix hotkey routines. We optimize it by using function pointers and
		merge three individual flags into one integer. Thanks to
		Qingning Huo for the suggestions.
	fix compile error on rxvt_init_font_fixed if xft is disabled.
	fix the name of icon files and description file in mrxvt.SlackBuild
		script.
	fix documents.


0.3.9 to 0.3.10
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add Scognito's beautiful icons for mrxvt. Now mrxvt has official
		icons! :-)
	add Pascal Bleser as SuSE package maintainer.
	add a new option to synchronize icon name with active tab, based
		on Terry Griffin's patch.
	add hotkey and escape sequence to toggle background transparency.
		This feature is experimental, though. It may not work well
		with tinting and other transparency related features.
	add .mrxvtrc as the default resource file, so that .Xdefaults is
		not filled by mrxvt settings any more. ;-)  Update all the
		documentations according to this change.
	add xftmSize option to specify the size of freetype multichar
		fonts. When it is difficult for mrxvt to find the best match
		of normal font and multichar font size, the user can adjust
		it manually.
	add xftSlowOutput option to fix display problem of some CJK fonts,
		like YZYuanTi. These fonts claims to have certain width, but
		the actual width is smaller. It makes the CJK characters
		clustered together with big space between non-CJK characters,
		which looks ugly.
	add -menu option. Now we can use -menu command line option besides
		of the X resource name to load menu.
	add hotkeys (Ctrl+Shift+<|>) to reorder active tab. Thanks to 
		Sergey Popov for the suggestion and patch.
	add escape sequence to reorder active tab.
	add an option (-vbf) to display color text with bold font. Add
		freetype bold font support as well.
	add hotkey and escape sequence to toggle very bold font display.
	fix hotkey routines. Now we define a set of functionality that can
		be done by hotkeys and let the users to define the hotkeys by
		themselves. We also have a set of default hotkeys. Thanks to
		Qingning Huo for all the hints and suggestions.
	remove windowSwitch option since it is not necessary any more.
	fix transparent screen refresh after the pixmap of root window has
		changed.
	fix default encoding method, change it to noenc to avoid troubles
		for non-multichar users.
	fix rxvt_font_init_xft. Only load the fixed font if xft is used.
		This avoid the abort when multichar is enabled, but fallback
		X11 fonts are not installed.
	fix rxvt_cmd_getc. Previously hack of race condition is incorrect,
		so it does not work at all! It is actually not a race
		condition, but a signal loss problem if multiple children are
		killed simultaneously. This time it should be fixed.
	fix configure.ac script. Replace AC_PATH_XTRA with AC_PATH_X. The
		latter does not add libXt, libICE automatically. Add libX11
		check. Fix fontconfig and xft check, especially for Solaris.
		And many thanks to Qingning Huo for testing and pointing out
		the problems in configure.ac.
	fix MONO_BOLD definition in thai.c.
	fix tabbar multichar string display error, especially when normal
		text and multichar text are mixed together.
	fix scrollTtyOutput inhibit. Instead of using the previous reverse
		definition, change it to scrollTtyOutputInhibit.
	fix menubar dispatch. If menubar is shown or hidden in dispatcher,
		resize the terminal window accordingly.
	fix CJK configuration options. Merge them into a single option:
		--enable-cjk.
	fix session restart style. Previously it is SmRestartImmediately,
		which cause gnome session manager to restart it immediately
		after an mrxvt terminal quits.
	fix FAQ. Update the PS1 tab title synchronization question
		according to Jacques Bouchard's suggestion.
	fix background pixmap command line option for menubar and tabbar,
		make them consistent to the option of scrollbar.
	fix tabbar event dispatcher when tabbar buttons are hidden.
	fix resource name of scrollbar options. Stuart Midgley pointed
		out this issue to me in the man page. Now the resource name
		of all scrollbar options are changed to `scrollbarBlahBlah'.
		Notice that here `scrollbar' is in lower case. However, I
		leave the option scrollBar unchanged, where `B' is in upper
		case.
	fix Ctrl_1..9 switch. If the current tab is in the second screen,
		like running vim, Ctrl_1..9 switch is disabled since it may
		be used by the application.
	fix primary screen check in tabbar.c, explicitly use PRIMARY. Do
		NOT assume it is 0, just like None/NULL check since it is
		more safe and portable.
	fix configure.ac, xgetdefault option is disabled by default.
		(Thanks to Terry Griffin for pointing it out to me)
	fix configure.ac, enable SM.h check only if session management
		is supported. Otherwise, we may get linking error if libSM
		is not presented while SM.h is there (is it possible?).
	fix configure.ac, enable libICE check for session management and
		libiconv on cygwin, simplify check of libxpg4 and libutil.
	fix freetype font size, set scale number to be 1.0 so that the
		size/pixel_size = 1.0.
	fix freetype multichar font size, optimize for simsun font.
	fix debian files according to Qingning Huo's diff file.
	fix compile error in pixmap.c when tinting support is disabled
	fix Makefile.am, comment out setuid install hook such that mrxvt
		will not be installed as setuid by default in the future for
		security concern.
	fix SlackBuild stript, we will use .tar.gz as source tarball name
		instead of .tgz. It seems all the world use it.
	update FAQ, CREDITS, README and NEWS.


0.3.8 to 0.3.9
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add a VB script (doc/mrxvt.vbs) to launch mrxvt directly from a
		Windows shortcut without a command prompt window for Cygwin
		users. This script is contributed by Matthew Melendy
	add option to hide/show tabbar buttons. apparently some people
		hate the buttons, as some others hate the tabbar ;-)
	add hotkey and escape sequence to hide/show tabbar buttons
	add further explanation of --enable-everything option in README
	add option of user supplied X resource file
	add option to avoid loading mfont when using freetype font, this
		can avoid large line space
	add escape sequence to change tab colors in runtime
	add support of X session management, still experimental
	add a short tutorial in doc/ directory on how to hack mrxvt and
		add new features
	add inactive tab highlighting when an inactive tab displays some
		new stuff. Remember that is not 100% persistent: it will be
		cleared if an tab expose event happens, e.g., creating a new
		tab or removing an old tab. But I guess it is enough by now.
		If people really concern about it, we can add a flag to each
		tab and use that flag to control the highlighting. But that
		might be overkill.
	fix printing of hold exit string on the screen after a child has
		died but is held
	fix borderless option, now support GNOME/KDE style hints
	fix bug in loading short command line option while long resource
		option is set to NULL, like -d
	fix freetype font size, turn back to point size instead of pixel
		size
	fix freetype multichar font loading. If the multichar font is the
		same as the normal font, e.g., when encoding method is NOENC,
		we use the normal font as multichar font. This eliminate the
		problem that the two fonts have different sizes. But this
		problem remains when the two fonts are different. This is
		because XFT function does not honor the font size we provide.
		Is there any way to fix this?
	fix internal border, which should be the internal border of the
		VT windows, not the mrxvt terminal window!
	fix computing of first visible tab and last visible tab. Now use
		a function to do it so that we can call this function outside
		of tabbar.c, especially when we hide/show tabbar buttons
	fix tab title width. Extend it to 507 maximal, but only display
		27 characters maximal in tab. Therefore, if we synchronize
		the terminal title with tab title, we can display the long
		tab title as terminal title without truncation.
	fix debian files (thanks to qingning huo)
	fix xft font opening routine, print warning message when actually
		opened font differs from the font wish to open
	fix pty/tty type check on BSD system - they require openpty that
		is in libutil. Why it seems unnecessary to fix it on FreeBSD
		5.2.1?
	fix error logic on updating previous active tab when we create
		tabs in sequence and remove them from the right to the left
	fix tabbar updating error if the last tab is removed
	fix include and library path on BSD systems
	fix compile error on macro PARENT_NUMBER if transparent is disabled
	fix compile error if scrollbar is not used
	fix int-border and ext-border option comments
	fix copyright information about rxvt-2.7.10-rk.patch
	fix missing lastlog file path on Solaris
	fix missing lastlog.h check
	fix tainted/untainted macros, use Cqual's notation so that we
		may use Cqual to check the source code in the future. It
		seems gcc compiler is happy with them. But I am not sure if
		other compilers feel happy too. :-)
	fix missing fontconfig macros on Mac OS X
	fix crashes on Mac OS X when calling times with NULL parameter
	fix iconv library check on Mac OS X
	fix xft tab title mixed chinese and english
	fix default gbk bitmap font
	fix terminal window and icon title if user supplies them
	fix assert macro (NDEBUG) on non-debug mode. Now if NDEBUG is
		defined, we will not have any assertions nor debug messages.
		If DEBUG is defined, assertions will always be built in the
		program, and we can use DEBUG_VERBOSE to control the debug
		message. By default, DEBUG_VERBOSE is not defined. So now it
		is clean to build mrxvt with debug support.
	fix SlackBuild script
	fix man page, add X resource name for each command line option
		if applicable
	delete unused rxvtRef-frame.html and rxvtRef-toc.html
	update LSM.in, FAQ, CREDITS, README and NEWS


0.3.7 to 0.3.8
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add option windowsSwitch to control behavior of Ctrl_Tab. If it is
		set, Ctrl_Tab switches to next tab like Windows. Otherwise, it
		activates the previous active tab.
	add xftfnmono flag if non-CJK font is mono-space
	add holdExit option and holdExitText resource on terminal exit
	add support of broadcasting input to all terminals
	add hot keys to toggle holding exit and broadcasting
	add desktop option for gnome compatible window manager
	add text shadow mode
	add option of transluscent window (true transparent). It requires
		translucent support of the X server, like Xorg 6.8. It will
		override the pseudo-transparency. Note: without hardware
		support to the X server, translucent window can cause
		significant performance penalty. You have been warned!!!
	add debian control files to build .deb package. Thanks to Xiong
		Jiang for help me figure it out.
	add checksum field to each terminal for checking rxvt_cmd_getc
	fix debug option, disable it by default since we are preparing a
		stable branch
	fix global command input and output buffer, move them to individual
		terminals. This may break something, so let us test it for a
		relatively long time.
	fix children exiting and clean code, so we can handle the case
		that multiple children terminals exit simultaneously. But a
		race condition still exists and this code is not robust
		enough. Is there any way to handle this?
	fix sigchld handling, enable reentrance of this signal handler
	fix configure check of iconv.h and libiconv for freetype font 
		support
	fix compile error when background image is disabled while xpm is
		enabled
	fix scrollbar style so that user can use command line option to
		specify it
	fix rxvt_set_window_color to restore and switch colors when input
		color is actually an index to our color list.
	fix shade value if it is changed by escape sequence
	fix xftmono flag if the width of freetype CJK font is not even
	fix xft font height when mfont and font have different height
	fix xft string drawing length after convert it to UTF-8
	fix compile error when there is no xft support
	fix an assertion failure on possible integer overflow
	fix tinting shade performance: if shade is 0, do not shade image
		at all
	fix global rvideo, rstyle, chstat, lost_multi and multi_byte, move
		them to individual terminals

0.3.6 to 0.3.7
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
	add experimental support to display Chinese/Japanese when use
		freetype font.
	add experimental support to display non-monospace freetype font.
		Basically, if the font is non-monospace (or normal freetype
		font width is not 1/2 of Chinese/Japanese freetype font),
		we will output the string one character by one character,
		not the entire string. This is a bit slow, but much safe.
	add option of multichar freetype font
	add option of cursor blinking interval time
	add option of borderless window (from gentoo)
	add option of override redirect (from gentoo)
	add option of bell command (from gentoo)

	fix EUCJ/SJIS encoding (http://gentoo.nedlinux.nl/distfiles/
		rxvt-2.7.10-rk.patch)
	fix Next/SGI style scrollbar width (too fat before)
	fix selection on 64bit systems (from suse)
	fix utmpx check for Interix (from netbsd)
	fix bsd os check (from netbsd)
	fix window properties, use X11R4 (and later) functions
	fix window resizing code

		width, size, slant and rgba options

	add option to fade transparent background or background image
		since many people have requested this feature :-)

		if the SHELL environment variable is not defined
	fix mouse report mode (hopefully) by moving PrivateModes and
		SavedModes from global to individual terminal
	fix default PrivateModes by removing PrivMode_aplKP. It seems
		that vim clears this flag anyway. However, if anything goes
		wrong, we will restore it
	fix configure.ac, use xft-config instead of pkg-config to find
		xft since some systems do not have pkg-config
	fix configure.ac for xft-config's complaint about rejection by
		preprocessor.
	fix xft font resource name
	fix xft font display residual and wipe problems
	fix tab title when use xft
	fix text shadow when use xft
	fix resizing when use xft. But apprently there is something wrong
		if we want to destroy the old font pattern. So now we do not
		destroy it, which wastes some system resources.
	fix active tab title color
	fix compile error if background image is disabled
	fix document install directory. Hope it is correct now!

	fix big5 encoding and default fonts
	fix korea encoding
	fix configure.ac to compile mrxvt using -fPIC option by default
		so that mrxvt can enjoy the benefit of PIE (position
		independent execution). In plaintext, it means mrxvt can be
		loaded into random memory location if the system supports it.
		It may reduce performance a little bit, e.g., 1% on x86, but
		can improve security.

Oezguer Kesim <kesim@math.fu-berlin.de>
	removed DONT_GUESS_BACKSPACE. Instead, you may define either
			FORCE_BACKSPACE or FORCE_DELETE or leave both undefined
		in order to get ^H, ^? or the current stty settings for
		'erase'
	fixed positioning of text in the top menubar.
	fixed some missing #define's
	fixed conditions for MONO_BOLD in scr_refresh() to make 
		  VERYBOLD work.

Christoph L. Spiel <Christoph_Spiel@physik.tu-muenchen.de>

2.21a3 to 2.21b*
\---------------
	 1. From: Conrad Link <conrad@akira.resnet.rochester.edu>
	Fixed a bug in the OffiX Drag and Drop support.
	rxvt inserted two instances of directories or links when they 
	were dropped onto rxvt.
	
	 2. From: <aner@zenith.att.com>
	Fixed a bug that makes rxvt getting constantly "NoExpose" events
	which it is not handling.

	 3. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Fixed a bug that caused rxvt to hang indefinitly waiting for a 
	terminating ^G on an XTerm `ESC]' sequence.

	 4. From: Bernard PERROT <perrot@lal.in2p3.fr>
		  Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Fixed a bug that prevented to handle DEC VT2xx's ApLineDel correctly

	 5. From: <vikas@insight.att.com>
		  Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Now the Shift/Ctrl cursor key mappings are enabled regardless of
	App-Cursor settings

	 6. From: Kai Petzke <wpp@mail.physik.TU-Berlin.DE>
	Fixed a bug with respect to cursor movement. rxvt now handles the
	'G' and 'd' sequences correctly

	 7. From: Geoff Wing <mason@primenet.com.au>
	Fixed a couple of things in utmp.c 

	 8. From: Denis N. Antonioli <antonio@ifi.unizh.ch>
	Added the "-tn" option and corresponding Xresource variable "termcap".
	This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the
	TERM environment variable. 

2.20 to 2.21a*
\-------------
	 1.	Oops, forgot to include time headers in menubar.c

	 2.	Finally got the correct DEC sequence to toggling the behaviour
	of the backspace key and removed the other non-standard ones.
	If anyone has a listing of DEC escape sequences they'd like to
	donate ...

	 3.	Fixed a bug that prevented an XPM file from being found if it
	were specified with an absolute path and a geometry string.
	Made the default scaling zero (tiled) since this is by far the
	most popular use.

	 4.	The Motif-style scrollbar is back as a compile-time option.

	 5.	Added BUGS file and (thankfully) moved coordination of the
	project to Oezguer Kesim <kesim@math.fu-berlin.de> who also
	has a mailing list for rxvt development

	Rxvt Workers <rxvt-workers@math.fu-berlin.de>

	To subscribe to the list send email to
	<rxvt@math.fu-berlin.de> with the body: subscribe

	 6.	Semi-retirement and finish my thesis ... bye for now - /mark

   --- Oezguer started working on rxvt

	 7. Fixed a bug in the new menubar-feature. There were several unchecked
	strings strcpy'ed which caused rxvt immediately to dump core.

	 8. From: Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>
		Fixed a bug in rclock.c which prevented it to compile correctly.

	 9. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
		Overstrike boldfonts and pixmaps now work together without pixel
		droppings on the screen (at least under Linux).

	10. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Modified autoconf support: memmove() replacement function
	supplied for those systems that need it, libXpm should now be
	correctly found (set in src/Makefile *not* in config.h)

	11.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Converted doc/rxvt.ref to HTML format.
		doc/html/refer.html = master copy
		doc/refer.txt  = text version saved using Netscape.

	All HTML documents are put in here, to ease installation
	elsewhere.

	12.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Moved some file search function from main.c and some string
	functions from xdefaults.c to misc.c.

	Changed the implementation details so that `keysym' resource
	is also available as a command-line long option ... even if
	you have compiled with USE_XGETDEFAULT.

	13.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	When a new pixmap is loaded, revert to the default scaling.

	14.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Reworked the menubar to permit multiple menubars in a circular
	linked list (and all the management functions that entains)
	and new functions including the following:

		* reading from files
		* dumping all the menubars
		* clearing a menu (without removing it)
		* setting a backgroudPixmap
		* and many other features.

	The menu syntax has changed very slightly from the last
	version, but now provides greater flexibility ... see
	refer.html for details.

	Added the `menu' resource/long-option so a startup menu
	can be specified. eg,
		rxvt -menu my.menu -e rlogin machine -l user

2.19 to 2.20
\-----------
	 1.	You can now add snazzy looking menus to any plain (non-X) text
	application.  At the moment, the menuing system is simple but
	functional.

	The syntax for controlling the menubar is documented in
	doc/rxvt.doc, but note that an XTerm sequence `ESC ] 10; Pt
	BEL' is used so menus created for rxvt will be ignored by an
	ordinary XTerm.

	It provides sub-menus, click-and-drag, and even some user
	definable `quick' arrows keys.  However menu manipulation
	could use refinement to permit multiple menus to be defined --
	and the menu refreshing could also use some improvement, but
	it can be extended and refined later as required/desired.

	The files doc/menu.sh and doc/jedmenu.sl show sample
	implementations of menus.

	  -->	It compiles and runs on my machine (AIX 3.2.5)
		but THIS IS CONSIDERED BETA (or even ALPHA) CODE!

	 2.	DEC private modes: Bug fix for 's'ave and 'r'estore parameters,
	added a 't'oggle parameter to DEC private modes.

	 3.	Made Backspace key selectable with DEC private mode
	ESC [ ? 36 h/l/s/r/t (high/low/save/restore/toggle)

	 4.	Changed the way the scrollBar is realized to permit on-the-fly
	toggling of the scrollBar display and added a DEC private mode
	escape sequence for that.  Smoother redraw of scrollBar.
	Better proportions for the arrows allows a slightly narrower
	scrollBar.

	 5.	Added support for XTerm font changing sequence:
	`ESC ] 50; Pt BEL', with (as usual) a few extras.
	See doc/rxvt.ref

	 6.	Adapted experimental XPM buffering from that supplied by
	Carsten Haitzler <raster@zip.com.au>.

	 7.	Replaced `wait' with `waitpid' in src/command.c::Child_signal
	to avoid a race condition and permit use of pclose() on SunOS.
	Patch provided by <davis@space.mit.edu>, Thanks John!

	 8.	For easier XPM handling, added `path' resource/long-option and
	substantially enhanced pixmap scaling to provide very exact
	control over scaling and positioning of the XPM background
	image.  The XPM XTerm escape sequence has been extended to
	provide a convenient facility for on-the-fly rescaling.
	Export COLORTERM="rxvt-xpm" instead of COLORTERM="rxvt"

	 9.	Added export COLORFGBG to give hints to color applications.
	Typically one of these values is exported, in which `fg' and
	`bg' are numbers 00-15:

	COLORFGBG="default;default"
		-fg -bg colors don't match any of color 0-15

	COLORFGBG="fg;default"
		-fg color matches color 0-15, but -bg color doesn't

	COLORFGBG="default;bg"
		-bg color matches color 0-15, but -fg color doesn't

	COLORFGBG="fg;bg"
		-fg -bg colors match color 0-15

	When compiled with XPM support, the last two values are
	rendered as follows:

	COLORFGBG="default;default;bg"
		-bg color matches color 0-15, but -fg color doesn't

	COLORFGBG="fg;default;bg"
		-fg -bg colors match color 0-15

	10.	Disable Shift+Prior/Next and scrollBar if saveLines == 0.
	Slight change to key-processing so `shift+meta+key' and
	`shift+ctrl+key' gets processed as `shift+key'.  This provides
	a way to avoid interpretating `Shift+Prior', `Shift+Next', and
	`Shift+Insert'.

	Also, added DEC private mode sequence `ESC [ ? 35 h/l/s/r/t'
	to disable Shift+key interpretation.

	Provide for Ctrl+Shift+<KEY> combinations for function keys.
	See doc/rxvt.ref

	11.	Always match long-option names, even when only preceded by a
	single -/+.

2.18 to 2.19
\-----------
	 1.	Minor alteration to input mode for Kanji processing.

	 2.	rclock: -adjust option, support for exec on startup syntax,
	date format may now also include the century

	 3.	Made mouse double-click respect autowrap lines.

	 4.	Added marks for folded editing.

	 5.	Added Offix DND (Drag 'n' Drop) protocol.
	Added support for XA_TARGETS.

	 6.	added Carsten Haitzler <raster@zip.com.au> XPM patches to load
	an XPM file for the background of the terminal window.
	Uses resource `Rxvt.backgroundPixmap' or long-option
	`--backgroundPixmap'

	 7.	Use these (XTerm) keybindings exclusively and remove the old
	equivalent bindings:
		Shift-Prior  = scroll up
		Shift-Next   = scroll down
		Shift-Insert = paste mouse selection

		Shift-KP_Add	  = bigger font
		Shift-KP_Subtract = smaller font

2.17 to 2.18
\-----------
	 1.	Check for NULL pointers in command-line processing (oops)
	Also fixed processing of `hidden' arguments such as -d, -g, -T

	 2.	Fixed terminfo hpa/vpa: was `\E..' instead of `\E[..'
	added invisible cursor (ESC[?25h / ESC[?25l)

	 3.	Fixed broken kanji characters (?? and disappeared cursor box ??)
	thanks to <manabe@Roy.dsl.tutics.tut.ac.jp>

	 4.	In privileges(), changed setuid/setgid to seteuid/seteguid so that
	it's possible to switch back to root later.

	Perhaps fixed svr4 problems (reports no tty, no job control) in
	get_tty() ... need to detect these SVR4 features in the configure
	script.

	 5.	Restored scrollColor, topShadowColor, bottomShadowColor resources
	that somehow got lost between the beta and release versions.  For
	monochrome displays, fixed scrollbar so it will be visible and
	suppress color changes.

	 6.	Final? iteration on selection.  Store selection text with LF
	line-endings but paste into rxvt with CR endings.  Selection now
	preserves the newline when trailing space is stripped from
	non-autowrap lines.  Compile-time support for using a keystroke to
	paste from the cut-buffer.

	 7.	Fixed utmp.c to handle both sysv and bsd pty names.  More changes in
	the works to improve documentation and eliminate race conditions ...
	this, thankfully, is being done by someone else.

	 8.	Added European language support (X11R6) - let me know of problems
	and fixes since I only have X11R5.

	 9.	Changed names of color10-color17 to color8-color15 to match with
	those used by color_xterm ... sorry for the inconvenience, but I
	didn't have an X11R6 xterm manpage until now and long-term
	compatibility is quite important.

	Added a real bold font (define USE_BOLDFONT).  I still think it's
	too much work to avoid pixel droppings for overstrike fonts.
	Added support for specifying colors for bold/underline
	(colorBD/colorUL) but it's only done when the foreground = the default
	foreground ... see the manpage.

	Compile-time selection of TERM="xterm-color".

	Reduced the number of rarely-used command-line options since they
	are accessible on the command-line via their resource names as long
	options.  More rigid differentiation between long and short options:
	long options are --/++ prefixed; short options -/+ prefixed.  Added
	long-option help to give the resource names.
	Removed run-time selection of right-hand scrollbar and arrows.
	Removed run-time selection of (pageup_key/pagedown_key/alert_key).

	10.	Changed Ctrl-Up,Down,Left,Right to emit "\EOa,b,c,d" instead of the
	previous "\E[^A,^B,^C,^D" to avoid problems associated with having
	an embedded "^C" in a key-sequence.  Disallow 80/132 column
	switching as the default (same as xterm).

	11.	Check for seteuid().  Add "ttcompat" module for SVR4.

	12.	A few people suggested removing the keystroke for toggling MapAlert
	and so I have.  I agree that it was pointless and/or annoying since
	there was no way of determining the current toggled state anyhow.

	13.	Fixed missing `ttydev' for _sgi.  Fixes for BSD utmp support.
	Exported WINDOWID before the window was created (oops).

	14.	Mouse cut&paste of autowrapped lines should be improved, fixed
	bug in screen.c::scroll_text().

	15.	As was pointed by a user -->> in keeping with X conventions, only an
	application that starts with 'x' should capitalize the first two
	letters of the resource file, so the rxvt resource file (and class
	name) should be named Rxvt not RXvt, this is a minor point.

	16.	rclock: As well as message reminders, rclock can launch programs and
	(if no message text is given) act as a cron-type of program.  Made
	default font `7x14'.  Fixed graphics context when mail is waiting
	and a reminder is issued - so the message is actually visible!

	17.	As suggested by a user, changed the bolding algorithm to be slightly
	more intuitive:
		1. colorBD (if specified)
		2. color0-7 -> color8-15 (if possible)
		3. boldFont (if specified and found)
		4. overstrike (last resort)

	This takes advantage of the color capability and is the most
	consistent when toggling font sizes on-the-fly.  If you never want
	overstrike (looks ugly and leaves pixel droppings) or boldFont (you
	like to switch font sizes on-the-fly), you can remove them at
	compile-time.  The other elements are similarly compile-time
	selectable.

	18.	Another user suggestion: scrollbar made more distinct by having the
	`trough' a different color from the slider -- I opted for making it
	the same as the default background color so that the slider and
	arrows appear to `float' on the window.  Also removed topShadowColor,
	bottomShadowColor resources as unnecessary.

	19.	Dropped distribution of vttest since Tom Dickey <dickey@clark.net>
	is working on an improved version.

2.16 to 2.17
\-----------
	 1.	Fixed problem in scr_refesh_region() that was introduced in v2.16
	The problem of `pixel droppings' continues when bold is simulated
	using overstrike.  Using XCopyArea() sometimes helps, but the
	preferred and simplest solution is item 4 below.

	2.	Removed 7bit mode.

	Changed definition of meta so that the ESCAPE is the default and
	using meta to set the 8bit on an option that can be made run-time
	configurable (assuming people still use this).

	Added -/+rv command-line option, resource reverseVideo.  NB: it works
	slightly differently from xterm's in that foreground/background are
	swapped even if they have been explicitly set.

	Removed NO_COLOR option -- no more monochrome rxvt (one too #ifdef's).

	Inherit existing stty settings (at least for control characters)
	and set value of BackSpace appropriately.

	Added defines DONT_GUESS_BACKSPACE and NO_DELETE_KEY

	3.	Added 3D style scrollbar and removed all the old bitmapped
	scrollbars and arrows with the only exception being the xterm
	lookalike XTERM_SCROLLBAR which is available in a single width.
	With arrows, scrollbar behaviour somewhat resembles Motif
	behaviour.  Without arrows, it's the standard xterm behaviour.

	The default scrollbar (defined at compile-time or set by using
	scrollBar: True) is to have a scrollbar with arrows arranged on the
	right-hand side. The scrollBar resource is now exclusively a boolean
	value

	scrollbar resources:

		scrollColor
		topShadowColor
		bottomShadowColor

	NB: if topShadowColor/bottomShadowColor are unset, their values are
		calculated from scrollColor using an algorithm adapted from
		fvwm so it shouldn't be too hard to find scrollbar colours that
		look good with your window manager and don't consume an entire
		colormap.

	4.	Added smarter handling of bold/blink when applied to the default
	fg/bg colours:

	If the pixel value of fg/bg matches the pixel value of colour COLOR0
	through COLOR7, then applying bold/blink to the default fg/bg will
	select the appropriate colour from BOLD0 through BOLD7 instead of
	using the overstrike bold.

	This seems to be the best way to handle bold/blink attributes when
	the foreground/background match and ANSI colour anyhow.  For
	convenience, it is possible to use colour aliases (next item) for
	the foreground/background colours instead.

	My preference is a dull Canadian look:

		RXvt*foreground:	7
		RXvt*background:	10

	5.	Changed colour aliases (item 7 of last change) and dropped the `#'
	prefix.  This avoids confusion with the regular #rrggbb format of
	specifying colours and is unambiguous since there are no X11 colours
	starting with a digit.  This also avoids the need to quote the `#'
	to protect against shell interpretation.

	6.	Added colour cursor support.
		-cr (cursorColor), as per XTerm -> the (rectangle) cursor colour
		-cr2 (cursorColor2), only RXvt -> the text colour.

	The cursorColor2 maintains contrast in a colour environment and
	is optional.

	Thanks Raul Garcia Garcia <rgg@tid.es> for the idea.
	Cleaned up scr_refresh (again <sigh>) to avoid some unnecessary
	colour changes and removed the reverse video graphics context and
	just swap foreground/background colours instead.

	7.	Typo in command.c: had seteuid() instead of seteguid() <sigh>
	Use cfsetospeed()/cfsetispeed() for POSIX termios handling.

	8.	Ignore the loginShell option/resource for programs that DON'T end
	with "sh".  A hack but it keeps `rxvt -ls -e rlogin machine' from
	failing and I don't know of (m)any shells that don't end in "sh".

	9.	Hard-code dependencies in Makefiles to avoid using X11 makedepend.
	Added check for atexit() to catch the problem that exists on SunOS
	but not on Solaris.

   10.  Collected command-line option parsing and X11 resources into a
	single file (xdefaults.c), and introduced a monolithic structure
	(with bit-flags for logical options) to eliminate the massive
	if-else-if parsing and to reduce possible overlaps/oversights

	Short help provided for an incorrect argument.

	For more consistency, more flexibility, and fewer switches,
	made -grk4/-grk9 options obsolete, and replaced with `-grk mode'.
	Added the resource `greek_keyboard' while I was there.

	It is also possible to use a `--' or `++' prefix to get so-called
	`long options' that correspond to the resource name.
	For example,

		rxvt +ls -bg Blue
		rxvt +loginShell -background Blue
		rxvt ++loginShell --background Blue

		rxvt ++ls --bg Blue		Error!

   11.	Changed REFRESH_PERIOD to 1 in command.c, the old idea of providing
	for fast and furious scrolling needs to be reconsidered so that `cat'
	works.  Still needs some investigation.

   12.	Changed scr_poweron(), which corresponds to `ESC c', to also reset
	the scrollback buffer.

   13.	Changed scr_change_screen() (when compiled with NO_SECONDARY_SCREEN)
	so that switching from the secondary to primary screen will push the
	old secondary screen into the scrollback buffer.  This is fairly
	useful if your terminfo has have rmcup=\E[?47l\E8, smcup=\E7\E[?47h.
	It is NOT particularly useful if rmcup includes \E[2J, like some do.

	Running with NO_SECONDARY_SCREEN provides faster switching than
	with a real secondary screen and saves memory too.

   14.	Now that key values have mostly stabilized, moved the compile-time
	key choices to "feature.h" ("keys.h" now obsolete).

2.15 to 2.16
\-----------
	1.	Misc cleanup, rxvt once again passes the vttest (and reverse video
	works again).  Kanji support tested and seems to be okay.  Finally,
	an okay set of regular/bold colours.  Compile-time option for a
	right-side scrollbar.

	2.	Ctrl-minus now (correctly) generates ^_ [0x1F].
	Changed termcap/terminfo to use normal cursor keys instead of
	application cursor keys (rmkx/smkx, ke/ks) -- otherwise subsequent
	rxvt/xterm starts with the application cursor keys active.

	3.	Fixed scr_reset() so that resizing is a lot more sensible.
	Implemented the equivalent SouthWest resizeGravity (xterm X11R5) so
	the bottom line of text on the screen stays fixed.  If the window is
	made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down onto the
	screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off
	the top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped. The
	old resizing code is available with -DOLD_UGLY_RESIZE.

	4.	Altered code so all man-page documented command-line options will
	not trigger errors even if the feature wasn't compiled into rxvt.
	Added old, backward compatibility command-line options, but they're
	simply ignored. Eventually they can be removed -- perhaps Jan'97?

		`-8':		use `+7'
		`-fat':		use `-sb'
		`-thin':	use `-arrows'
		`-meta8thbit'	use `-meta8'
		`-metaescape'	use `-meta'
		`-font_list'	use `-font1', `-font2', etc.

	These ones are just too weird to support:

		`-ls-':		use `+ls'
		`-ma-':		use `+ma'

	5.	Removed secure-keyboard option, too problematic and obscure.

	6.	First attempt at GNU autoconfig.
	Still needs some work, but it's mostly okay.

	7.	Added minor aliases for foreground/background colours.  This permits
	colour specifications like -fg "#13" -bg "#10", which would set the
	foreground to colour 13 (bright yellow) and the background to colour
	10 (bright black).  It's not terribly useful yet, but might
	eventually be a nice way to have bold/blink colour work even on with
	the standard fg/bg colours.

2.14 to 2.15
\-----------
	1.	Small bug: initial width incorrect when there was no scrollBar.

	2.	Close the gaping security hole.  Renounce setuid/setgid privileges
	immediately and only take them up as needed -- chown() or writing
	into /etc/utmp.

	3.	Reverted to using `<' and '>' to toggle smaller/bigger fonts. It
	seems that many didn't like KP_Subtract/XK_KP_Add -- conflicts with
	some editors, and not all terminals have a Keypad anyhow.

	4.	Man page reformatted by Piercarlo Grandi <piercarl@sabi.demon.co.uk>
	so that it "now is done in the most delightful [sic] elegant 'roff
	style :-)"

	5.	Started to integrate the Kanji support based on old patches from the
	Linux-JE (Japanese Extensions) project.  Consider it alpha until one
	of the JE authors gives it a thorough check.

	6.	Added compile-time selection of a few different scrollbar widths.

	7.	When reading X resources, rxvt now recognizes two class names:
	"XTerm" and "RXvt".  The reason for two distinct names is that there
	are many options common between rxvt and xterm -- to which the class
	name "XTerm" permits easy access and configuration -- but there are
	also several options, notably colours and key-handling, unique to
	rxvt but which are useful to share between different rxvt
	configurations; the class name "RXvt" permits this.

	NB: The "RXvt" class takes precedence (in the event of a clash) and
		is the only one ever used for the application defaults file.

	8.	The initial value used for the Backspace key (^H or ^?) is now
	determined from the value of CERASE used to set the termios
	structures.  This removes the need for the BACKSPACE_AS_DELETE
	compile-time option.

2.13 to 2.14
\-----------
	1.	Default HOTKEY prefix can now be choosen as `meta', `ctrl' or
	`shift'. Moved font toggle to KP_Add/KP_Subtract to resemble
	resolution toggling of the XFree86 server (Linux) and so that Alt-<
	can generate ESC-< for Emacs usage.  Man page and usage() reflect
	the changes. Note that if you choose the hotkey to be `shift', to
	mimic the Linux console scrollback, you'll probably want different
	keybindings for mapAlert and Secure.

	The choice of the HOTKEY (ctrl or meta) prefix and some of the
	key-strings can be compile-time defined in "rxvtkeys.h", although
	probably the only changes desired will be in the string value
	associated with XK_Delete and in the choice of a HOTKEY (ctrl or
	meta) prefix.

	Use shift or ctrl to temporarily toggle Backspace from ^H to ^?.
	Use shift to temporarily toggle the application keypad.

	2.	Patch so that setting bold or blink works before or after changing
	the colour (it used to only work before changing the colour). Also
	added the option of having DOS VGA colours.
	Thanks Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@foxnet.net>

	3.	Extensive reworking of pseudo-tty handling and addition of BSD sgtty
	terminal handling and new utmpx (Solaris 2.x) support. MANY thanks
	to Raul Garcia Garcia (rgg@tid.es).

	POSIX wtmp support added by Piet W. Plomp (piet@icce.rug.nl)

	Added -/+ut option (resource: utmpInhibit) so you can sometimes be
	harder to find :)

	4.	Finally? cleaned-up selection so that it works properly -- clears a
	previously selected region without causing a core dump -- define
	NEW_SELECTION.

	I believe that this should fix a long-standing problem with the
	selection mechanism -- probably back from when selection of the
	scrollback was added -- whereby all accounting was done in terms of
	screen row values [0 .. RxvtWin.rows-1] plus the current offset
	value.  The anchor and end points were scrolled with the screen, but
	the beginning point wasn't and extending a region that had its
	anchor scrolled-off would give complete garbage.  The new selection
	scheme has lots of bounds-checking (too much?) to prevent these
	problems.  If PRINT_PIPE is not defined, then you can use
	PrintScreen to dump some of the current selection state -- this
	should help debugging.

	Thanks to John Davis (davis@space.mit.edu) and Piet W. Plomp
	(piet@icce.rug.nl) for helping to diagnose the problem.

	5.	Use information request `ESC [ 8 n' to change the window title
	to the current rxvt version so you can find out what version you
	have.

	6.	Added simple code to permit run-time definition of the keysyms
	0xFF00 - 0xFFFF if KEYSYM_RESOURCE (for FAKE_RESOURCES only) is
	defined.  It's not as pretty as that used by xterm since it only
	works with keysym values rather that key names, but the impact on
	code size is quite minimal.  I use it in conjunction with `-name vm'
	to remap arrow and function keys for tn3270 ... quite handy.
	At the moment the string length is only limited by the line length
	(currently 256) used in "resources.c"

	The syntax (at the moment) is

		rxvt*keysym.0xFFnn:	"a string value"

	where `nn' is a 2 digit hex value 00 to FF.  Of course if there were
	an easy and small means of converting key names to keysym values,
	then that would be better.

	The enclosing quotes are required to start/end with whitespace.
	Most of the usual escape values can be used:

		\b - backspace
		\e - escape
		\n - newline
		\r - carriage return
		\t - tab
		\000 - octal number

	Anyhow, here's a brief example of what it looks like
	in ~/.Xdefaults:

	! F11 key - mimic the output of F1
	rxvt*keysym.0xFFC8: \e[11~

	! F12 key - whatever
	rxvt*keysym.0xFFC9: Hello World!\n"\"String\" ends with whitespace  "

	! Delete key - remap
	rxvt*keysym.0xFFFF: "Delete :)"

	!Scroll_Lock as flow-control (^S)
	rxvt*keysym.0xFF14: \023

	7.	Oops -- fixed resource name from scrollbar to scrollBar. Fixed
	cursor colours to black on white (like xterm) for the scrollbar
	cursors, but I've left the xterm (`I'-bar) cursor as foreground on
	background because it looks so nice.  Allocate all colours when
	creating the window so that we don't have to worry about it later
	and so that we can avoid potential hassles with colour-hungry
	applications like Netscape.

	8.  Added a way to distinguish an rxvt from an xterm via the obsolete
	ESC Z sending the vt100 answer string with 'c' -> 'C'.

	Added support for resolving the actual IP number of the host for
	remote DISPLAYs.  Changed the answer back for ESC[7n to add a
	trailing newline to support easier input into the shell.  When the
	display is local (i.e. :0), we add support for sending the first
	non-loopback interface IP number as the DISPLAY instead of just
	sending the incorrect ":0".  This way telnet/rlogin shells can
	actually get the correct information into DISPLAY for xclients.

	[Note: I've not had a chance to thoroughly test this -- mjo]

2.12 to 2.13
\-----------
	1.	Shift and Control now only work for non-application mode cursor
	keys and with function keys.

	2.	Override XTerm mouse reporting with either Mod1 or Shift.  X11
	mouse reporting now properly includes modifier keys (see rxvt.ref).
	Although this effectively degenerates to the Control modifier alone
	since both Shift and Meta are used to temporarily disable mouse
	reporting -- I don't know an easy way around this but that's what
	XTerm does, although since it uses Control to pop-up menus, that
	doesn't get transmitted either.

	3.  Moved a few more configuration items from Imakefile to configure.h

	4.	Added XAPPLOADDIR define to the Imakefile to allow use of the
	application defaults file XAPPLOADDIR/RXvt when rxvt has been
	compiled with FAKE_RESOURCES.  Now, the following files are
	checked:
		XAPPLOADDIR/RXvt	(compile-time defined)
		$HOME/.Xdefaults or $HOME/.Xresources
	suggested by John Gotts <jgotts@engin.umich.edu>

	5.	Applied patches by Edward D.H. Liu <dhliu@solar.csie.ntu.edu.tw>
	to fix the speed of pasting rxvt's selection to motif, xew or tk.
	Finally! reasonable pasting speed to these applications.

	6.	patches by Gregory Margo <gmargo@newton.vip.best.com>
	for xterm-style proportional scrollbar behaviour:
		If pointer is near top, scroll one line.
		If pointer is near bottom, scroll full page.
	refreshPeriod resource and -refresh option ... still wishing
	for faster screen refreshing.

	7.	Bug fix for partial matches (FAKE_RESOURCES).  In addition to
	resources for resource name `rxvt', also get resources for class
	name `XTerm' as well.  Remove checking for `command' resource since
	it's not found in xterm nor was there any code in place to parse the
	command arguments ... better just to use the command-line -e option.
	Replace `fontList' with font1, font2, ... etc. for better xterm
	compatibility and for ease of configuration.  Changed processing of
	string resources and command-line string options to avoid allocating
	redundant memory.

	8.	Previously selected region is now properly cleared when Button1 is
	pressed.  Still have problems with click-and-drag when Mod1 or Shift
	is used to override mouse reporting -- argh!  Until someone gets
	this properly patched, use Button1 followed by Button3 (to extend
	region) in these instances.

	9.	Understands ANSI set default fg/bg colour (\E[39m / \E[49m)

   10.	In the screen accounting used in screen.c, use a '\n' to terminate
	wrapped lines instead of '\0'.  This should avoid mouse selection of
	wrapped lines from including a bogus newline.  No known
	side-effects, but changes isolated by #define NEW_WRAPTYPE.

2.11 to 2.12
\-----------
	1.	Extra functionality for XTerm mouse report mode.  If mouse reporting
	is enabled (the application will handle mouse events) the normal
	scrollbar operation is disabled -- instead rxvt sends UP/DOWN for
	the arrow buttons and PageUp/PageDown when Button1 or Button3 are
	clicked on the scrollbar.  Use Mod1 (Alt) key to get the normal
	scrollbar/arrow button actions and also to get the normal selection
	functions -- so that you can still cut/paste between X applications.

	2.	New colour possibilities -- 16 colours.  Instead of using fatter
	characters, a bold attribute now uses a brighter foreground colour.
	Similarly, a blink attribute will use a brighter background colour.
	It is also possible to choose these colours through the resources
	(color0 -- color7) permit specification of the ANSI colours (black,
	red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white), the resources
	(color10 -- color17) are the brighter bold/blink equivalents.
	Define USE_FAKE_BOLD to disable.

	3.	Extensive clean-up of source and headers to separate
	interdependencies, remove unused variables.  Introduced static
	variables wherever possible to limit scoping and reduced the number
	of external variables.

	4.	Allow NumLock to toggle on/off the application keypad.

	Backspace sends '\b', Ctrl-Backspace sends '\177'.
	Define BACKSPACE_AS_DELETE to reverse these values or use the
	escape sequence:

		ESC [ 36 h		Backspace key sends BS
		ESC [ 36 l		Backspace key sends DEL

	XK_End used to send "\033Ow", which is identical to XK_KP_7 and
	confuses EDT-type editors. Now,
	Home = "\033[7~"
	End  = "\033[8~"

	Changed Alert & Secure keys from Alt-i & Alt-s to Alt-I & Alt-S so
	they aren't so easily toggled.

	5.	Extra keystroke info.  Pass Control and Shift indicators for
	function keys (similar to the XJed editor)
	eg,
		F1	= ESC [11~
		C-F1	= ESC [11^
		S-F1	= ESC [11$

	also, pass indication of shift status for arrow-keys
	eg,
		Up, Down, Right, Left
		  = ESC [A, ESC [B, ESC [C, ESC [D
		S-Up, S-Down, S-Right, S-Left
		  = ESC [a, ESC [b, ESC [c, ESC [d

	You wouldn't be able to use these keys for termcap/terminfo
	applications, but the key sequences are available for remapping
	within an application.

	6.	Added configure.h which is included by each source file and by the
	Imakefile.  Common compilation defines are now all contained in
	configure.h with minor system defines remaining in Imakefile --
	makes it much easier to configure.  Used XCOMM macro in Imakefile so
	that it actually works.  Also added defaults.h for defining
	user-specific startup defaults.

	7.	Added rxvt.ref to provide documentation of the various terminal
	sequences that are processed.  Updated man page to reflect changes.

	8.	Use xterm-style -/+ to turn on/off options, rationalized resource
	names to more closely resemble xterm.

	9.	Fixed Button actions for XTerm-style scrollbar so that Button1 and
	Button3 do different things as they are supposed to.  Replace -/+fat
	with -/+sb and -/+arrows for more consistency with XTerm. Decreased
	width of `fat' scrollbar (make closer to xterm) and increased width
	of `thin' scrollbar (arrows too small) -- they are now the same
	width.  Also made it possible to remove the scrollbar altogether.
	Added a visual bell.

	Added many more defines to further reduce code size for various
	cases, see "configure.h".  It is also possible to alter settings in
	"defaults.h" for configuration options that will only affect
	screen.c and xsetup.c, this should help with compile-time
	customization for those who don't want to use Xdefaults.

	Added the define REPLACE_SELECTION_NEWLINE to make the substitution
	of newlines with carriage returns for selection pasting a
	compile-time option.

   10.	Fixed the graphics samples so that if you want to it's actually
	possible to compile them.  Added -name command-line option so that
	it's possible to select different sets of resources.

   11.  Integrated initial support for X11 mouse reporting and added
	Shift + Function Keys support.

2.10 to 2.11
	1.	If NEW_COLOR_MODEL is defined in screen.c, the new model I described
	in an earlier email is used. (apparantly there are two, slightly
	differnt models for using color extensions in a vt-compatible
	terminal. This flag lets you switch.

	2.	If XTERM_MOUSE_REPORT is defined in command.c, mouse reporting is
	turned on/off via the appropriate escape sequences.  XTerm already
	provides this support.

	3.	If .Xdefaults does not exist, .Xresources is searched for.  It seems
	that many here use .Xresources.

2.09 to 2.10
	1.	Really fixed the color problem (?) Got color-ls, and it works now.
	2.	Added patch to allow run-time selection of font list.

2.07 to 2.09
	1.	Fixed some color-usage errors.
	2.	Added double and triple-click support
	compliments of ah@doc.ic.ac.uk (Angelo Haritsis)
	3.	Added Print Screen capability, as in most vt-100's
2.06 to 2.07
	1.	Fixed problems with rxvt screwing up tty permisssions (?)
2.03 to 2.06
	1.	Fixed a limit which imposed a maximum width for the
	terminal window of 255 characters. There is no limit now.
	2.	Made provision for applications to get mouse-click feedback
	when user clicks in a graphics window. See graphics_sample
2.02 to 2.03
	1.	Fixed memory management just a little.

2.0 to 2.02
	1.	Bug fixes for color and graphics.

1.97 to 2.0
	1.	Added ANSI color support. Compile with -DCOLOR
	2.	Added a graphics mode. Compile with -DGRAPHICS
1.96 to 1.97
	1.	Bug in refresh() which was causing slow refreshes after
	clear-screens was fixed. Showed up during emacs start-up.

1.95 to 1.96
	1.	rxvt did bad things if it received mouse - Motion events
	without a preceeding button-press. Fixed.
1.94 to 1.95
	1.	Created a substitute for XGetDefaults, which seemed to account for
	1/2 to 2/3 of the memory used by rxvt (according to the SIZE field
	of ps output). My substitute only reads the .Xdefaults file. Compile
	with -DFAKE_RESOURCES to get my mini- XDefaults handling,
	-DREAL_RESOURCES to keep XGetDefault.

1.93 to 1.94
	1.	Fixed some minor long-standing errors in the vt100 emulation.
	2.	Fixed ALT-<char> handling in command.c
	3.	Fixed minor bug with start-of-selection location.
	4.	Added xterm-type "extend selection" feature using
	mouse button 3. Button 1 always starts a new selection. Button3
	tries to extend the current selection if possible.
	5.	Fixed problem with bold-face fonts overflowing into
		the next character for some fonts.

1.92 to 1.93
	1.	ran gprof to find bottle-necks in the code. Halved user
	time, but had little effect on total time required to
	update the display. Seems worth keeping for the more efficient
	user-time, though. At this point, I think that most of the elapsed
	time is spent waiting for input or waiting for the X buffers
	to flush.
	2.	Used to refresh the screen every 2.2 screen-fulls during
	flat-out scrolling. Really cuts down on scroll-time. Now,
	refresh every screen-full (or when there's a pause in activity),
	but when flat-out scrolling starts, decrease the refresh period,
	so that its every 10th screenful after a little while. This has
	no noticeable visible effect, since the scrolling text is
	absolutely unintelligible anyway, but will improve the scroll
	"feel" when doing just one or two screenfulls, ie in an ls -l.
	3.	Surrounded  the code which uses XCopyArea with #ifdef's
	I have never seen this help performance, but I think that there
	may be some video-systems which benefit from this, particularly
	in a full-screen editor or slow scrolling type of setting.
	4.	Performance in flat out scrolling, text only, on a sparc-10,
	displaying rxvt on an HDS x-terminal:
	  nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time rxvt -e cat k
		6.1 real		 3.1 user		 2.5 sys
	  nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time xterm -e cat k
		40.8 real		 4.6 user		 3.4 sys

1.91 to 1.92
	1.	Added greek-keyboard support patches.
1.85 to 1.91
	1.	assorted minor patches
1.82 to 1.85
	1.	Fixed ESC c handling.
	2.	Fixed minor selection handling bug.

1.81 to 1.82
	1.	Fixed slow refresh during selection process
	2.	Fixed problem of not correctly clearing selections of 1 character.

1.80 to 1.81
	1.	Fixed some scrolling problems, problems with partially obscured
	windows.
	2.	Added some neat debugging capability in debug.c
	3.	Patched up rclock.

1.74 to 1.80
	1.	Fixed core dump from selecting past the bottom of the screen
	2.	Fixed a few escape sequences, per the vttest program
	3.	Broke and fixed handling of moved/resize/new-font handling.
	4.	Still can't change tab stops correctly.
	5.	Ran vt-100 test suite. Added capability to change tab stops
	and enter reverse video, and to switch from 80 to 132
	columns and back. Fixed a seg-fault in scroll().

1.70 to 1.74
	1.	Fixed cursor drawing errors.
	2.	Improved smoothness of scroll-back operations.
	3.	Applied some SVR4 patches.
	4.	Applied HPUX patches, and a few cursor display patches
	5.	Fixed up font-changing routines a bit.
	6.	Fixed a scrolling problem for windows taller than the scroll-back
	buffer.

1.6 to 1.7
	1.	Fixed the problem with random rendition flags in the scroll
	back buffer
	2.	Fiddled with re-drawing on the scroll-bar, and with
	how often refreshing occurs.
	3.	Incorporated some AIX patches.
	4.	Included #ifdef'd changes to support vt100 printer.
	5.	Fixed send_string routine, so that it doesn't loose
	data.
	6.	Complete re-write of screen.c
1.5 to 1.6
	1.	Removed all use of a seperate bold font. Now uses
	over-striking exclusively.
	2.	Added some more optimizations for drawing speed when
	the window is re-sized or moved.
	3.	Implemented speed ups in screen.c

1.47 to 1.48
	1.	Cleaned up re-drawing on expose events, so rxvt only
	re-draws the newly exposed parts of the screen.
	2.	Fixed backspace, which must have broken in 1.45.
	3.	Added command line option of iconic startup.

from 1.45 to 1.47
	1.	Incorporated improved bsd utmp handling from
		dperry@ringer.cs.utsa.edu (David Perry)
	2.	Fixed a very minor bug where the solid-cursor can leave a
		a bit of a ghost when you resize the window. Its stupid,
	but it always bothered me.

from 1.4 to 1.45
	1.	Fixed scrolling error when switching to larger fonts
	2.	Fixed utmp-entry removal for SYSV type systems.
	3.	Icorportated patches for FreeBSD and svr4
