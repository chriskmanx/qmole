Using GNU auto tools
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  If script `configure' does not exist, execute `bootstrap.sh' to
    generate it. To do so, you will need GNU automake, autoconf,
    and libtool.

    Notice on Solaris, automake and autoconf require perl to be
    installed in /usr/local/bin, but by default perl is installed in
    /usr/bin. You can make a symbol link of perl in /usr/local/bin.

2.  Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
    ./configure --help gives a list of possible options with slightly
    longer descriptions in README.configure. A quick way to enable
	all features while disable debug is like this:

		./configure --enable-everything --disable-debug

    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking
    that the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give
    `configure' initial values for variables by setting them in the
    environment.  Using a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that
    on the command line like this:

        CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

    Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:

        env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

    Or if you're using a non Bourne-compatible shell, you can do:

        sh -c 'CFLAGS="-O2 -g" ./configure

3.  Set any other main preferences:

    Edit "src/feature.h"

    Edit "config.h"   if you didn't use ./configure options

    If you're cross-compiling, edit the following in "config.h"

        NO_XLOCALE
        SIZEOF_*    # sizeof some types
        R*INT*T     # types which are the same size
                    # as 16bit/32bit/pointer

4.  Build it (repeat step 2 as desired):

        make

5.  Install mrxvt :

        make install

    You may also want to install doc/etc/rxvt.terminfo and 
    doc/etc/rxvt.termcap

6 a.If compiled with UTMP_SUPPORT but without utempter library
	support, you may need to install mrxvt with setuid root or
	setuid/setgid to match the file ownership and permissions
	on /etc/utmp (or /var/run/utmp).

6 b.You may need to install setuid root anyway for some systems so
    that they can give you ownership of the tty devices.


    ===================================

NB: SunOS (with/without gcc?) gets reported by configure as

        #undef STDC_HEADERS
        #define HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H 1

    but the ioctl() defines aren't protected against multiple
    inclusion, in this case by <termios.h> so use a hack in
    "feature.h" to avoid the problem.

    Gave up checking for `STDC_HEADERS', since they really should
    be there and I don't want to deal with the problems when they
    don't exist.

    SunOS users might complain to the right places and get their
    system headers fixed so that one day the rest of us won't have
    to keep compensating :(

    SVR4 users (that aren't using gcc) will have to add -DSVR4 to
    CPPFLAGS for configure.
