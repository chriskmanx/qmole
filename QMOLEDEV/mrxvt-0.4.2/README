00   INTRODUCTION

Mrxvt is a multi-tabbed (like gnome-terminal/konsole) terminal emulator
for the X Window System. It targets to be light-weight, so the desktop
environment, like CDE, KDE or GTK is not required in order to run it.
It achieves this without losing the common useful features, like tab,
image and pseudo-transparent background, multi-style scrollbars, XIM
and CJK support, etc.



01   A BRIEF HISTORY

You can safely skip this section if you do not have time.

For years, a multi-tabbed rxvt has been requested by the users with
no luck. Now, things have changed! Mrxvt (previously named as materm)
is a tabbed X terminal emulator based on aterm/rxvt. It's small,
fast, portable, feature rich and only depends on X library.

An early version of mrxvt is based on multi-aterm v0.1 and named
materm. Multi-aterm was first developed by Alexis from 2002 based
on aterm. But the development seems to stop in 2004 without reaching
a usable stable status. So I took over the project, began to hack it
and renamed it to materm. I have made lots of changes to the code
since I dislike the original code style. Hopefully, I have not
broken too many things. ;-)

Due to the limits of aterm, many features are not well implemented
in materm, such as XIM support. So after release 0.2, I decided to
pick up the latest rxvt as the base of new development branch. And
the name of the project is changed to mrxvt. This branch is completely
new compared to the branch prior to 0.2. I have found that rxvt coding
style is much better than aterm (except the indent is horrible ;-)),
and it is enjoyable to work on it. I have also ported many features
from aterm and eterm to mrxvt, like tinting and text shadow. Be aware
that some features in the new branch are slightly different from
release 0.2, e.g., color background tinting is available for each
individual terminal in release 0.2, but is global from 0.3.0.



02   BUG REPORT AND FAQ

Bug reports are very welcome! You can build mrxvt with debug
support. So if you have gdb in your system, you may run mrxvt in
gdb with the source to track down the bug, and report it to me.

To save both your time and my time, please write down detailed steps
to replicate the bug. If I cannot replicate it by myself, I will
ignore it even if it may destroy the universe.

Patches are extremely welcome since I am not familiar with many
things, like multi-languages and accent.

In addition, I may not have time to update the documents in time.
Feel free to help me and the users to improve them. Translations
are also welcome. Of course, not from C to C++ or something like
that! You know my meaning of translations.

If you run into certain problems, please read the FAQ file and the
man page before trying to contact me! Your question may be answered
by them already. I most likely will dump your question to /dev/null
if it is already answered there.



03   BUILD AND INSTALL

To build and install from the source, please read INSTALL file!

A quick (lazy) choice is to configure mrxvt as the following. After
you --enable-everything, usually there is no need to enable other
options explicitly. I have found that many distributions, like
gentoo, enable other options with --enable-everything. This is NOT
necessary in fact. The option is a shortcut to avoid a long list of
configuration options. (Apparently few people pay attention to the
README and README.configure. Shall we burn the README? ;-))

	$ ./configure --enable-everything --disable-debug



04   CONFIGURATION FILE

To run mrxvt with your own preferences, you can set X resources in
~/.mrxvtrc. A sample xdefaults-sample.txt is included in the doc/
directory, and you can start to hack your own ~/.mrxvtrc from it.
Alternative configuration files are ~/.Xdefaults and ~/.Xresources.
Most options in the ~/.mrxvtrc can be replace by a (short) command
line option - of course, if you like command line options.



05   HOTKEY BINDINGS

Several hot key combinations are available for keyboard users. Mrxvt
is designed to be as flexible as possible. It can be surprising to
see that many features can be altered during runtime using hotkeys
or escape sequences. Please read the doc/TIPS for a list of them. Be
aware that they may be changed in the near future because the
shortage of combinations for all features. ;-)

If you do not like the default hot key combinations, you can define
the combinations by yourself. Please read the man page to find out
how to define them.



06   CJK DISPLAY AND INPUT

To display and input Chinese (Korea/Japanese), you can do the
following:

	. Configure mrxvt with "--enable-cjk --enable-xim" options, and
build it.

	. Install the correct CJK fonts. Mrxvt will try to look for some
default CJK fonts if you do not specify them  using the -fm option
or mfont X resource name. The default CJK fonts are listed in the
src/encoding.h file. Notice that they are -fm and mfont, NOT -fn and
font!!! If you use freetype font, use -xftfm option to specify the
CJK font family. Notice that -fm and -xftfm options use different
formats of font names. For details about the difference, read the FAQ
file.

	. Set environment variable LC_CTYPE to zh_CN. Make sure to unset
environment variable LC_ALL, otherwise LC_CTYPE is overrided. Notice
that this setting is global for all the following commands you will
type in the same shell session. You can supply the environment variable
to mrxvt at runtime instead of setting it globally here. Keep reading
the following for details.

	. Set X resources in ~/.mrxvtrc. Notice that the value of
inputMethod is case sensitive.

		mrxvt*mfont:              hanzigb16st
		mrxvt*xftmfont:           simsun
		mrxvt*xftSize:            14
		mrxvt*multichar_encoding: GB
		mrxvt*inputMethod:        SCIM

	. Start the SCIM X input server as usual. For example:

		$ # for ksh/bash users
		$ LC_ALL=zh_CN LANG=zh_CN scim -d
		$ # for csh/tcsh users
		$ env LC_ALL=zh_CN LANG=zh_CN scim -d

	. Execute mrxvt. You can supply the environment variable LC_CTYPE
and XMODIFIERS to mrxvt at runtime instead of setting them globally
as above. All you need to do is to run mrxvt as following:

		# the following command is for bash/ksh
		LC_CTYPE=zh_CN XMODIFIERS=@im=SCIM mrxvt &
		# the following command is for csh/tcsh
		env LC_CTYPE=zh_CN XMODIFIERS=@im=SCIM mrxvt &

	. Focus on the mrxvt window, click Ctrl_Space to invoke SCIM

	. For Linux, set environment variable LC_ALL (for scim) and 
LC_CTYPE (for mrxvt) to zh_CN or zh_CN.gbk are both good for
SCIM/fcitx input. For FreeBSD, they must be zh_CN.eucCN for fcitx
input.

Mrxvt is tested to work with SCIM, fcitx and gcin. It should work fine
with other X Input methods, like xcin, Chinput and miniChinput. It is
reported to work with French ascent as well.

If you cannot find mrxvt in your favorite system (especially open
source systems like Linux and BSD), you may try to contact the
system developers and request them to add it into the system. :-)



09   KNOWN ISSUES

Here are several known issues of mrxvt:

	. UTF-8 is not supported yet.

	. Some users report that they have problem to envoke the SCIM
Chinese input method under Gentoo 2004.3 and Debian Sarge. I have
no idea why this is the case because it always works for me. The
solution? Dump Gentoo/Debian and turn to Slackware, or trace the
program and send me patch. ;-)

	. To build mrxvt on HP-UX, you need to disable logging features.

	. Background image support requires libxpm, libpng or libjpeg
be installed. The images are only tiled on the background of the
terminal window. They cannot be scaled to fit the window size.

	. XFT support requires freetype, xft and fontconfig libraries
be installed. Multichar support under XFT requires GNU iconv library
be installed, which is usually included in GLIBC for Linux systems.

	. If swap screen option is disabled, screen scrolling may behave
randomly. ;-)  So the safe choice is to always enable it.

	. Tinting and pseudo-transparent are global since 0.3.0. Well,
we could implement tinting and pseudo-transparent for each individual
terminal (not a technical difficulty), but it will significantly
increase the X resources usage since each terminal needs at least
one pixmap.

	. Thai support is incomplete since I do not know too much about
it and do not have the Thai fonts.

	. Off-focus fading does not work under XFT in order to save
resources. This may be fixed in the future.

	. Certain characters, e.g., characters with accent in European 
languages may not be correctly displayed under XFT.

	. If cursor blinking is enabled, to print the hold exit text on
the screen may be delayed after several blinking. Similarly, the
child may stay for a while before completely quits.



10   SECURITY ISSUES

Here are several security issues of mrxvt:

	Before 0.3.10, by default, mrxvt binary is installed as setuid
	root. Although we have tried hard to avoid security problems
	raised by setuid root permission, we do not guarantee 100%
	safety. You have been warned!!! From 0.3.10, mrxvt binary will
	be installed without setuid root due to security concerns. Thus,
	if mrxvt is not compiled with utempter library support, you will
	lose the logging features.

	From 0.3.5, mrxvt supports utempter library, which means if you
	have installed the utempter library, you can remove the setuid
	root permission from mrxvt binary without losing the logging
	feature. But doing so may cause trouble to chown the tty on some
	systems.
