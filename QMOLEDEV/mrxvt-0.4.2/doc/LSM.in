Description:	@MRXVT_WEBPAGE@
		Mrxvt is a terminal emulator for X Window System. It provides
		DEC VT102 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use
		the window system directly. The primary features of mrxvt
		include (but not limit to) multi-tab and runtime changeable
		tab titles, session for each tab, input broadcasting, true
		translucent window, fast pseudo-transparent background, user
		supplied background images (XPM, JPEG, PNG), background color
		tinting, off-focus fading, text shadow, multiple style (NeXT,
		Rxvt, Xterm, SGI, Plain) scrollbar, XIM, multi-languages
		(Chinese, Korean, Japanese), freetype font and logging. Like
		rxvt, mrxvt aims to be light, fast, flexible and desktop
		independant, thus KDE or GNOME are not required.
