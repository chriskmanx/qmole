## *** DEFAULT SETTINGS FOR THE ATTACHMENTS PATCH ***
##

##
## Please see the manual (section "attachments")  for detailed
## documentation of the "attachments" command.
##
## Removing a pattern from a list removes that pattern literally. It
## does not remove any type matching the pattern.
##
##  attachments   +A */.*
##  attachments   +A image/jpeg
##  unattachments +A */.*
##
## This leaves "attached" image/jpeg files on the allowed attachments
## list. It does not remove all items, as you might expect, because the
## second */.* is not a matching expression at this time.
##
## Remember: "unattachments" only undoes what "attachments" has done!
## It does not trigger any matching on actual messages.

## Qualify any MIME part with an "attachment" disposition, EXCEPT for
## text/x-vcard and application/pgp parts. (PGP parts are already known
## to mutt, and can be searched for with ~g, ~G, and ~k.)
##
## I've added x-pkcs7 to this, since it functions (for S/MIME)
## analogously to PGP signature attachments. S/MIME isn't supported
## in a stock mutt build, but we can still treat it specially here.
##
attachments   +A */.*
attachments   -A text/x-vcard application/pgp.*
attachments   -A application/x-pkcs7-.*

## Discount all MIME parts with an "inline" disposition, unless they're
## text/plain. (Why inline a text/plain part unless it's external to the
## message flow?)
##
attachments   +I text/plain
  
## These two lines make Mutt qualify MIME containers.  (So, for example,
## a message/rfc822 forward will count as an attachment.)  The first
## line is unnecessary if you already have "attach-allow */.*", of
## course.  These are off by default!  The MIME elements contained
## within a message/* or multipart/* are still examined, even if the
## containers themselves don't qualify.
##
#attachments  +A message/.* multipart/.*
#attachments  +I message/.* multipart/.*

## You probably don't really care to know about deleted attachments.
attachments   -A message/external-body
attachments   -I message/external-body

# set abort_nosubject=ask-yes
#
# Name: abort_nosubject
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is given
# at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to
# no, composing messages with no subject given at the subject
# prompt will never be aborted.
# 
# 
# set abort_unmodified=yes
#
# Name: abort_unmodified
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set to yes, composition will automatically abort after
# editing the message body if no changes are made to the file (this
# check only happens after the first edit of the file).  When set
# to no, composition will never be aborted.
# 
# 
# set alias_file="~/.muttrc"
#
# Name: alias_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.muttrc"
# 
# 
# The default file in which to save aliases created by the
# <create-alias> function. Entries added to this file are
# encoded in the character set specified by $config_charset if it
# is set or the current character set otherwise.
# 
# Note: Mutt will not automatically source this file; you must
# explicitly use the ``source'' command for it to be executed in case
# this option points to a dedicated alias file.
# 
# The default for this option is the currently used muttrc file, or
# ``~/.muttrc'' if no user muttrc was found.
# 
# 
# set alias_format="%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r"
#
# Name: alias_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r"
# 
# 
# Specifies the format of the data displayed for the ``alias'' menu.  The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
# %a      alias name
# %f      flags - currently, a ``d'' for an alias marked for deletion
# %n      index number
# %r      address which alias expands to
# %t      character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion
# 
# 
# set allow_8bit=yes
#
# Name: allow_8bit
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either Quoted-
# Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.
# 
# 
# set allow_ansi=no
#
# Name: allow_ansi
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in
# rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
# Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
# their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
# your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
# message could include a line like
# [-- PGP output follows ...
# 
# and give it the same color as your attachment color (see also
# $crypt_timestamp).
# 
# 
# set arrow_cursor=no
#
# Name: arrow_cursor
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, an arrow (``->'') will be used to indicate the current entry
# in menus instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
# links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
# be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
# in the menu.
# 
# 
# set ascii_chars=no
#
# Name: ascii_chars
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
# and attachment trees, instead of the default ACS characters.
# 
# 
# set askbcc=no
#
# Name: askbcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients
# before editing an outgoing message.
# 
# 
# set askcc=no
#
# Name: askcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will prompt you for carbon-copy (Cc) recipients before
# editing the body of an outgoing message.
# 
# 
# set assumed_charset=""
#
# Name: assumed_charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
# schemes for messages without character encoding indication.
# Header field values and message body content without character encoding
# indication would be assumed that they are written in one of this list.
# By default, all the header fields and message body without any charset
# indication are assumed to be in ``us-ascii''.
# 
# For example, Japanese users might prefer this:
# set assumed_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
# 
# However, only the first content is valid for the message body.
# 
# 
# set attach_charset=""
#
# Name: attach_charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
# schemes for text file attachments. Mutt uses this setting to guess
# which encoding files being attached are encoded in to convert them to
# a proper character set given in $send_charset.
# 
# If unset, the value of $charset will be used instead.
# For example, the following configuration would work for Japanese
# text handling:
# set attach_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
# 
# Note: for Japanese users, ``iso-2022-*'' must be put at the head
# of the value as shown above if included.
# 
# 
# set attach_format="%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%> [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] "
#
# Name: attach_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%> [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] "
# 
# 
# This variable describes the format of the ``attachment'' menu.  The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are understood:
# %C      charset
# %c      requires charset conversion (``n'' or ``c'')
# %D      deleted flag
# %d      description
# %e      MIME content-transfer-encoding
# %f      filename
# %I      disposition (``I'' for inline, ``A'' for attachment)
# %m      major MIME type
# %M      MIME subtype
# %n      attachment number
# %Q      ``Q'', if MIME part qualifies for attachment counting
# %s      size
# %t      tagged flag
# %T      graphic tree characters
# %u      unlink (=to delete) flag
# %X      number of qualifying MIME parts in this part and its children
#         (please see the ``attachments'' section for possible speed effects)
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character ``X''
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character ``X''
# %*X     soft-fill with character ``X'' as pad
# 
# 
# For an explanation of ``soft-fill'', see the $index_format documentation.
# 
# 
# set attach_sep="\n"
#
# Name: attach_sep
# Type: string
# Default: "\n"
# 
# 
# The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
# printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.
# 
# 
# set attach_split=yes
#
# Name: attach_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
# etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt will concatenate the
# attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
# $attach_sep separator is added after each attachment. When set,
# Mutt will operate on the attachments one by one.
# 
# 
# set attribution="On %d, %n wrote:"
#
# Name: attribution
# Type: string
# Default: "On %d, %n wrote:"
# 
# 
# This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
# in a reply.  For a full listing of defined printf(3)-like sequences see
# the section on $index_format.
# 
# 
# set auto_tag=no
#
# Name: auto_tag
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, functions in the index menu which affect a message
# will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
# unset, you must first use the <tag-prefix> function (bound to ``;''
# by default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.
# 
# 
# set autoedit=no
#
# Name: autoedit
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set along with $edit_headers, Mutt will skip the initial
# send-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and allow you to
# immediately begin editing the body of your
# message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
# editing the body of your message.
# 
# Note: when this option is set, you cannot use send-hooks that depend
# on the recipients when composing a new (non-reply) message, as the initial
# list of recipients is empty.
# 
# Also see $fast_reply.
# 
# 
# set beep=yes
#
# Name: beep
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error occurs.
# 
# 
# set beep_new=no
#
# Name: beep_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep whenever it prints a message
# notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
# $beep variable.
# 
# 
# set bounce=ask-yes
#
# Name: bounce
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
# If set to yes you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
# message. Setting this variable to no is not generally useful,
# and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.
# 
# 
# set bounce_delivered=yes
#
# Name: bounce_delivered
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will include Delivered-To headers when
# bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to unset this variable.
# 
# 
# set braille_friendly=no
#
# Name: braille_friendly
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will place the cursor at the beginning
# of the current line in menus, even when the $arrow_cursor variable
# is unset, making it easier for blind persons using Braille displays to
# follow these menus.  The option is unset by default because many
# visual terminals don't permit making the cursor invisible.
# 
# 
# set certificate_file="~/.mutt_certificates"
#
# Name: certificate_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.mutt_certificates"
# 
# 
# This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust
# are saved. When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked
# if you accept it or not. If you accept it, the certificate can also
# be saved in this file and further connections are automatically
# accepted.
# 
# You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
# certificate that is signed with one of these CA certificates is
# also automatically accepted.
# 
# Example:
# set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates
# 
# 
# set charset=""
#
# Name: charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Character set your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.
# It is also the fallback for $send_charset.
# 
# Upon startup Mutt tries to derive this value from environment variables
# such as $LC_CTYPE or $LANG.
# 
# Note: It should only be set in case Mutt isn't able to determine the
# character set used correctly.
# 
# 
# set check_mbox_size=no
#
# Name: check_mbox_size
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will use file size attribute instead of
# access time when checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf folders.
# 
# This variable is unset by default and should only be enabled when
# new mail detection for these folder types is unreliable or doesn't work.
# 
# Note that enabling this variable should happen before any ``mailboxes''
# directives occur in configuration files regarding mbox or mmdf folders
# because mutt needs to determine the initial new mail status of such a
# mailbox by performing a fast mailbox scan when it is defined.
# Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size changes.
# 
# 
# set check_new=yes
#
# Name: check_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style
# mailboxes.
# 
# When set, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while the
# mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
# take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
# checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
# this variable is unset, no check for new mail is performed
# while the mailbox is open.
# 
# 
# set collapse_unread=yes
#
# Name: collapse_unread
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
# unread messages.
# 
# 
# set compose_format="-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
#
# Name: compose_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
# 
# 
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the ``compose''
# menu.  This string is similar to $status_format, but has its own
# set of printf(3)-like sequences:
# %a      total number of attachments
# %h      local hostname
# %l      approximate size (in bytes) of the current message
# %v      Mutt version string
# 
# 
# See the text describing the $status_format option for more
# information on how to set $compose_format.
# 
# 
# set config_charset=""
#
# Name: config_charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When defined, Mutt will recode commands in rc files from this
# encoding to the current character set as specified by $charset
# and aliases written to $alias_file from the current character set.
# 
# Please note that if setting $charset it must be done before
# setting $config_charset.
# 
# Recoding should be avoided as it may render unconvertable
# characters as question marks which can lead to undesired
# side effects (for example in regular expressions).
# 
# 
# set confirmappend=yes
#
# Name: confirmappend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to
# an existing mailbox.
# 
# 
# set confirmcreate=yes
#
# Name: confirmcreate
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a
# mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.
# 
# 
# set connect_timeout=30
#
# Name: connect_timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 30
# 
# 
# Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP, POP or SMTP) after this
# many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
# value causes Mutt to wait indefinitely for the connection attempt to succeed.
# 
# 
# set content_type="text/plain"
#
# Name: content_type
# Type: string
# Default: "text/plain"
# 
# 
# Sets the default Content-Type for the body of newly composed messages.
# 
# 
# set copy=yes
#
# Name: copy
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages
# will be saved for later references.  Also see $record,
# $save_name, $force_name and ``fcc-hook''.
# 
# 
# set crypt_autoencrypt=no
#
# Name: crypt_autoencrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP
# encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in
# connection to the ``send-hook'' command.  It can be overridden
# by use of the pgp menu, when encryption is not required or
# signing is requested as well.  If $smime_is_default is set,
# then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and
# settings can be overridden by use of the smime menu instead.
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set crypt_autopgp=yes
#
# Name: crypt_autopgp
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not mutt may automatically enable
# PGP encryption/signing for messages.  See also $crypt_autoencrypt,
# $crypt_replyencrypt,
# $crypt_autosign, $crypt_replysign and $smime_is_default.
# 
# 
# set crypt_autosign=no
#
# Name: crypt_autosign
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to
# cryptographically sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden
# by use of the pgp menu, when signing is not required or
# encryption is requested as well. If $smime_is_default is set,
# then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and settings can
# be overridden by use of the smime menu instead of the pgp menu.
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set crypt_autosmime=yes
#
# Name: crypt_autosmime
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not mutt may automatically enable
# S/MIME encryption/signing for messages. See also $crypt_autoencrypt,
# $crypt_replyencrypt,
# $crypt_autosign, $crypt_replysign and $smime_is_default.
# 
# 
# set crypt_replyencrypt=yes
#
# Name: crypt_replyencrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL encrypt replies to messages which are
# encrypted.
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set crypt_replysign=no
#
# Name: crypt_replysign
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages which are
# signed.
# 
# Note: this does not work on messages that are encrypted
# and signed!
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set crypt_replysignencrypted=no
#
# Name: crypt_replysignencrypted
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages
# which are encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
# $crypt_replyencrypt, because it allows you to sign all
# messages which are automatically encrypted.  This works around
# the problem noted in $crypt_replysign, that mutt is not able
# to find out whether an encrypted message is also signed.
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set crypt_timestamp=yes
#
# Name: crypt_timestamp
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will include a time stamp in the lines surrounding
# PGP or S/MIME output, so spoofing such lines is more difficult.
# If you are using colors to mark these lines, and rely on these,
# you may unset this setting.
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set crypt_use_gpgme=no
#
# Name: crypt_use_gpgme
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls the use of the GPGME-enabled crypto backends.
# If it is set and Mutt was built with gpgme support, the gpgme code for
# S/MIME and PGP will be used instead of the classic code.  Note that
# you need to set this option in .muttrc; it won't have any effect when
# used interactively.
# 
# 
# set crypt_use_pka=no
#
# Name: crypt_use_pka
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls whether mutt uses PKA
# (see http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf) during signature
# verification (only supported by the GPGME backend).
# 
# 
# set crypt_verify_sig=yes
#
# Name: crypt_verify_sig
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If ``yes'', always attempt to verify PGP or S/MIME signatures.
# If ``ask-*'', ask whether or not to verify the signature.
# If ``no'', never attempt to verify cryptographic signatures.
# (Crypto only)
# 
# 
# set date_format="!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
#
# Name: date_format
# Type: string
# Default: "!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the format of the date printed by the ``%d''
# sequence in $index_format.  This is passed to the strftime(3)
# function to process the date, see the man page for the proper syntax.
# 
# Unless the first character in the string is a bang (``!''), the month
# and week day names are expanded according to the locale specified in
# the variable $locale. If the first character in the string is a
# bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
# rest of the string are expanded in the C locale (that is in US
# English).
# 
# 
# set default_hook="~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
#
# Name: default_hook
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
# 
# 
# This variable controls how ``message-hook'', ``reply-hook'', ``send-hook'',
# ``send2-hook'', ``save-hook'', and ``fcc-hook'' will
# be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp,
# instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
# declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
# variable at the time the hook is declared.
# 
# The default value matches
# if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
# given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
# ``alternates'') and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
# regular expression.
# 
# 
# set delete=ask-yes
#
# Name: delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not messages are really deleted when closing or
# synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to yes, messages marked for
# deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.  If set to
# no, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.
# 
# 
# set delete_untag=yes
#
# Name: delete_untag
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this option is set, mutt will untag messages when marking them
# for deletion.  This applies when you either explicitly delete a message,
# or when you save it to another folder.
# 
# 
# set digest_collapse=yes
#
# Name: digest_collapse
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this option is set, mutt's received-attachments menu will not show the subparts of
# individual messages in a multipart/digest.  To see these subparts, press ``v'' on that menu.
# 
# 
# set display_filter=""
#
# Name: display_filter
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
# is viewed it is passed as standard input to $display_filter, and the
# filtered message is read from the standard output.
# 
# 
# set dotlock_program="/usr/local/bin/mutt_dotlock"
#
# Name: dotlock_program
# Type: path
# Default: "/usr/local/bin/mutt_dotlock"
# 
# 
# Contains the path of the mutt_dotlock(8) binary to be used by
# mutt.
# 
# 
# set dsn_notify=""
#
# Name: dsn_notify
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
# string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
# of the following: never, to never request notification,
# failure, to request notification on transmission failure,
# delay, to be notified of message delays, success, to be
# notified of successful transmission.
# 
# Example:
# set dsn_notify="failure,delay"
# 
# Note: when using $sendmail for delivery, you should not enable
# this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a MTA
# providing a sendmail(1)-compatible interface supporting the -N option
# for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it
# depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.
# 
# 
# set dsn_return=""
#
# Name: dsn_return
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN
# messages.  It may be set to either hdrs to return just the
# message header, or full to return the full message.
# 
# Example:
# set dsn_return=hdrs
# 
# Note: when using $sendmail for delivery, you should not enable
# this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a MTA
# providing a sendmail(1)-compatible interface supporting the -R option
# for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it
# depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.
# 
# 
# set duplicate_threads=yes
#
# Name: duplicate_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether mutt, when $sort is set to threads, threads
# messages with the same Message-Id together.  If it is set, it will indicate
# that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an equals sign
# in the thread tree.
# 
# 
# set edit_headers=no
#
# Name: edit_headers
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages
# along with the body of your message.
# 
# Note that changes made to the References: and Date: headers are
# ignored for interoperability reasons.
# 
# 
# set editor=""
#
# Name: editor
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which editor is used by mutt.
# It defaults to the value of the $VISUAL, or $EDITOR, environment
# variable, or to the string ``vi'' if neither of those are set.
# 
# 
# set encode_from=no
#
# Name: encode_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages when
# they contain the string ``From '' (note the trailing space) in the beginning of a line.
# This is useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
# agents tend to do with messages (in order to prevent tools from
# misinterpreting the line as a mbox message separator).
# 
# 
# set entropy_file=""
#
# Name: entropy_file
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# The file which includes random data that is used to initialize SSL
# library functions.
# 
# 
# set envelope_from_address=""
#
# Name: envelope_from_address
# Type: e-mail address
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Manually sets the envelope sender for outgoing messages.
# This value is ignored if $use_envelope_from is unset.
# 
# 
# set escape="~"
#
# Name: escape
# Type: string
# Default: "~"
# 
# 
# Escape character to use for functions in the built-in editor.
# 
# 
# set fast_reply=no
#
# Name: fast_reply
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped
# when replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is
# skipped when forwarding messages.
# 
# Note: this variable has no effect when the $autoedit
# variable is set.
# 
# 
# set fcc_attach=yes
#
# Name: fcc_attach
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages
# are saved along with the main body of your message.
# 
# 
# set fcc_clear=no
#
# Name: fcc_clear
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and
# unsigned, even when the actual message is encrypted and/or
# signed.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set folder="~/Mail"
#
# Name: folder
# Type: path
# Default: "~/Mail"
# 
# 
# Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A ``+'' or ``='' at the
# beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of this
# variable.  Note that if you change this variable (from the default)
# value you need to make sure that the assignment occurs before
# you use ``+'' or ``='' for any other variables since expansion takes place
# when handling the ``mailboxes'' command.
# 
# 
# set folder_format="%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f"
#
# Name: folder_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the file browser display to your
# personal taste.  This string is similar to $index_format, but has
# its own set of printf(3)-like sequences:
# %C      current file number
# %d      date/time folder was last modified
# %D      date/time folder was last modified using $date_format.
# %f      filename (``/'' is appended to directory names,
#         ``@'' to symbolic links and ``*'' to executable
#         files)
# %F      file permissions
# %g      group name (or numeric gid, if missing)
# %l      number of hard links
# %N      N if folder has new mail, blank otherwise
# %s      size in bytes
# %t      ``*'' if the file is tagged, blank otherwise
# %u      owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character ``X''
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character ``X''
# %*X     soft-fill with character ``X'' as pad
# 
# 
# For an explanation of ``soft-fill'', see the $index_format documentation.
# 
# 
# set followup_to=yes
#
# Name: followup_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not the ``Mail-Followup-To:'' header field is
# generated when sending mail.  When set, Mutt will generate this
# field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
# the ``subscribe'' or ``lists'' commands.
# 
# This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from
# receiving duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send
# to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply
# separately for any messages sent to known lists to which you are
# not subscribed.
# 
# The header will contain only the list's address
# for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own
# email address for unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a
# group reply to your message sent to a subscribed list will be
# sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two copies
# of the same email for you.
# 
# 
# set force_name=no
#
# Name: force_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable is similar to $save_name, except that Mutt will
# store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
# you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.
# 
# Also see the $record variable.
# 
# 
# set forward_decode=yes
#
# Name: forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message.  The message header is also RFC2047 decoded.
# This variable is only used, if $mime_forward is unset,
# otherwise $mime_forward_decode is used instead.
# 
# 
# set forward_decrypt=yes
#
# Name: forward_decrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the handling of encrypted messages when forwarding a message.
# When set, the outer layer of encryption is stripped off.  This
# variable is only used if $mime_forward is set and
# $mime_forward_decode is unset.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set forward_edit=yes
#
# Name: forward_edit
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This quadoption controls whether or not the user is automatically
# placed in the editor when forwarding messages.  For those who always want
# to forward with no modification, use a setting of ``no''.
# 
# 
# set forward_format="[%a: %s]"
#
# Name: forward_format
# Type: string
# Default: "[%a: %s]"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
# It uses the same format sequences as the $index_format variable.
# 
# 
# set forward_quote=no
#
# Name: forward_quote
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, forwarded messages included in the main body of the
# message (when $mime_forward is unset) will be quoted using
# $indent_string.
# 
# 
# set from=""
#
# Name: from
# Type: e-mail address
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When set, this variable contains a default from address.  It
# can be overridden using ``my_hdr'' (including from a ``send-hook'') and
# $reverse_name.  This variable is ignored if $use_from is unset.
# 
# This setting defaults to the contents of the environment variable $EMAIL.
# 
# 
# set gecos_mask="^[^,]*"
#
# Name: gecos_mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^[^,]*"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
# entry when expanding the alias.  The default value
# will return the string up to the first ``,'' encountered.
# If the GECOS field contains a string like ``lastname, firstname'' then you
# should set it to ``.*''.
# 
# This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address an e-mail
# to user ID ``stevef'' whose full name is ``Steve Franklin''.  If mutt expands
# ``stevef'' to ``"Franklin" stevef@foo.bar'' then you should set the $gecos_mask to
# a regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt will expand
# ``Franklin'' to ``Franklin, Steve''.
# 
# 
# set hdrs=yes
#
# Name: hdrs
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, the header fields normally added by the ``my_hdr''
# command are not created.  This variable must be unset before
# composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If set,
# the user defined header fields are added to every new message.
# 
# 
# set header=no
#
# Name: header
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the header
# of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
# The $weed setting applies.
# 
# 
# set header_cache=""
#
# Name: header_cache
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable points to the header cache database.
# If pointing to a directory Mutt will contain a header cache
# database file per folder, if pointing to a file that file will
# be a single global header cache. By default it is unset so no header
# caching will be used.
# 
# Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening POP, IMAP
# MH or Maildir folders, see ``caching'' for details.
# 
# 
# set header_cache_compress=yes
#
# Name: header_cache_compress
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When mutt is compiled with qdbm or tokyocabinet as header cache backend,
# this option determines whether the database will be compressed.
# Compression results in database files roughly being one fifth
# of the usual diskspace, but the decompression can result in a
# slower opening of cached folder(s) which in general is still
# much faster than opening non header cached folders.
# 
# 
# set header_cache_pagesize="16384"
#
# Name: header_cache_pagesize
# Type: string
# Default: "16384"
# 
# 
# When mutt is compiled with either gdbm or bdb4 as the header cache backend,
# this option changes the database page size.  Too large or too small
# values can waste space, memory, or CPU time. The default should be more
# or less optimal for most use cases.
# 
# 
# set help=yes
#
# Name: help
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
# provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
# 
# Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
# function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
# the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is
# running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
# of these should present a major problem.
# 
# 
# set hidden_host=no
#
# Name: hidden_host
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will skip the host name part of $hostname variable
# when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
# affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the
# cut-off of first-level domains.
# 
# 
# set hide_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
# by limiting, in the thread tree.
# 
# 
# set hide_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_missing
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the
# thread tree.
# 
# 
# set hide_thread_subject=yes
#
# Name: hide_thread_subject
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the subject of messages in the thread
# tree that have the same subject as their parent or closest previously
# displayed sibling.
# 
# 
# set hide_top_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_top_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
# by limiting, at the top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when
# $hide_limited is set, this option will have no effect.
# 
# 
# set hide_top_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_top_missing
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the
# top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when $hide_missing is
# set, this option will have no effect.
# 
# 
# set history=10
#
# Name: history
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
# the string history buffer per category. The buffer is cleared each time the
# variable is set.
# 
# 
# set history_file="~/.mutthistory"
#
# Name: history_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.mutthistory"
# 
# 
# The file in which Mutt will save its history.
# 
# 
# set honor_disposition=no
#
# Name: honor_disposition
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will not display attachments with a
# disposition of ``attachment'' inline even if it could
# render the part to plain text. These MIME parts can only
# be viewed from the attachment menu.
# 
# If unset, Mutt will render all MIME parts it can
# properly transform to plain text.
# 
# 
# set honor_followup_to=yes
#
# Name: honor_followup_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
# honored when group-replying to a message.
# 
# 
# set hostname=""
#
# Name: hostname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the system mutt is running on
# containing the host's name and the DNS domain it belongs to. It is used
# as the domain part (after ``@'') for local email addresses as well as
# Message-Id headers.
# 
# Its value is determined at startup as follows: If the node's name
# as returned by the uname(3) function contains the hostname and the
# domain, these are used to construct $hostname. If there is no
# domain part returned, Mutt will look for a ``domain'' or ``search''
# line in /etc/resolv.conf to determine the domain. Optionally, Mutt
# can be compiled with a fixed domain name in which case a detected
# one is not used.
# 
# Also see $use_domain and $hidden_host.
# 
# 
# set ignore_linear_white_space=no
#
# Name: ignore_linear_white_space
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This option replaces linear-white-space between encoded-word
# and text to a single space to prevent the display of MIME-encoded
# ``Subject:'' field from being divided into multiple lines.
# 
# 
# set ignore_list_reply_to=no
#
# Name: ignore_list_reply_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Affects the behavior of the <reply> function when replying to
# messages from mailing lists (as defined by the ``subscribe'' or
# ``lists'' commands).  When set, if the ``Reply-To:'' field is
# set to the same value as the ``To:'' field, Mutt assumes that the
# ``Reply-To:'' field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
# to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
# mailing list when this option is set, use the <list-reply>
# function; <group-reply> will reply to both the sender and the
# list.
# 
# 
# set imap_authenticators=""
#
# Name: imap_authenticators
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are either ``login'' or the right
# side of an IMAP ``AUTH=xxx'' capability string, e.g. ``digest-md5'', ``gssapi''
# or ``cram-md5''. This option is case-insensitive. If it's
# unset (the default) mutt will try all available methods,
# in order from most-secure to least-secure.
# 
# Example:
# set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram-md5:login"
# 
# Note: Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
# the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
# authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.
# 
# 
# set imap_check_subscribed=no
#
# Name: imap_check_subscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders from
# your server on connection, and add them to the set of mailboxes
# it polls for new mail just as if you had issued individual ``mailboxes''
# commands.
# 
# 
# set imap_delim_chars="/."
#
# Name: imap_delim_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "/."
# 
# 
# This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat
# as folder separators for displaying IMAP paths. In particular it
# helps in using the ``='' shortcut for your folder variable.
# 
# 
# set imap_headers=""
#
# Name: imap_headers
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Mutt requests these header fields in addition to the default headers
# (``Date:'', ``From:'', ``Subject:'', ``To:'', ``Cc:'', ``Message-Id:'',
# ``References:'', ``Content-Type:'', ``Content-Description:'', ``In-Reply-To:'',
# ``Reply-To:'', ``Lines:'', ``List-Post:'', ``X-Label:'') from IMAP
# servers before displaying the index menu. You may want to add more
# headers for spam detection.
# 
# Note: This is a space separated list, items should be uppercase
# and not contain the colon, e.g. ``X-BOGOSITY X-SPAM-STATUS'' for the
# ``X-Bogosity:'' and ``X-Spam-Status:'' header fields.
# 
# 
# set imap_idle=no
#
# Name: imap_idle
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will attempt to use the IMAP IDLE extension
# to check for new mail in the current mailbox. Some servers
# (dovecot was the inspiration for this option) react badly
# to mutt's implementation. If your connection seems to freeze
# up periodically, try unsetting this.
# 
# 
# set imap_keepalive=900
#
# Name: imap_keepalive
# Type: number
# Default: 900
# 
# 
# This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that mutt
# will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
# from closing them before mutt has finished with them. The default is
# well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
# a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
# violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
# getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.
# 
# 
# set imap_list_subscribed=no
#
# Name: imap_list_subscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
# only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
# IMAP browser with the <toggle-subscribed> function.
# 
# 
# set imap_login=""
#
# Name: imap_login
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Your login name on the IMAP server.
# 
# This variable defaults to the value of $imap_user.
# 
# 
# set imap_pass=""
#
# Name: imap_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, Mutt will
# prompt you for your password when you invoke the <imap-fetch-mail> function
# or try to open an IMAP folder.
# 
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even
# if you are the only one who can read the file.
# 
# 
# set imap_passive=yes
#
# Name: imap_passive
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
# mail.  Mutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
# connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted to
# user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or if opening the connection
# is slow.
# 
# 
# set imap_peek=yes
#
# Name: imap_peek
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
# you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
# but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
# exists to appease speed freaks.
# 
# 
# set imap_pipeline_depth=15
#
# Name: imap_pipeline_depth
# Type: number
# Default: 15
# 
# 
# Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued up before they
# are sent to the server. A deeper pipeline reduces the amount of time
# mutt must wait for the server, and can make IMAP servers feel much
# more responsive. But not all servers correctly handle pipelined commands,
# so if you have problems you might want to try setting this variable to 0.
# 
# Note: Changes to this variable have no effect on open connections.
# 
# 
# set imap_servernoise=yes
#
# Name: imap_servernoise
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
# server as error messages. Since these messages are often
# harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
# server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
# them at some point.
# 
# 
# set imap_user=""
#
# Name: imap_user
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP
# server.
# 
# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
# 
# 
# set implicit_autoview=no
#
# Name: implicit_autoview
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set to ``yes'', mutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
# ``copiousoutput'' flag set for every MIME attachment it doesn't have
# an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, mutt will
# use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
# form.
# 
# 
# set include=ask-yes
#
# Name: include
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to
# is included in your reply.
# 
# 
# set include_onlyfirst=no
#
# Name: include_onlyfirst
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt includes only the first attachment
# of the message you are replying.
# 
# 
# set indent_string="> "
#
# Name: indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: "> "
# 
# 
# Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
# message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
# change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.
# 
# The value of this option is ignored if $text_flowed is set, too because
# the quoting mechanism is strictly defined for format=flowed.
# 
# This option is a format string, please see the description of
# $index_format for supported printf(3)-style sequences.
# 
# 
# set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
#
# Name: index_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the message index display to

# ``Format strings'' are similar to the strings used in the C
# function printf(3) to format output (see the man page for more details).
# The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
# %a      address of the author
# %A      reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)
# %b      filename of the original message folder (think mailbox)
# %B      the list to which the letter was sent, or else the folder name (%b).
# %c      number of characters (bytes) in the message
# %C      current message number
# %d      date and time of the message in the format specified by
# $date_format         converted to sender's time zone
# %D      date and time of the message in the format specified by
# $date_format         converted to the local time zone
# %e      current message number in thread
# %E      number of messages in current thread
# %f      sender (address + real name), either From: or Return-Path:
# %F      author name, or recipient name if the message is from you
# %H      spam attribute(s) of this message
# %i      message-id of the current message
# %l      number of lines in the message (does not work with maildir,
#         mh, and possibly IMAP folders)
# %L      If an address in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' header field matches an address
#         defined by the users ``subscribe'' command, this displays
#         "To <list-name>", otherwise the same as %F.
# %m      total number of message in the mailbox
# %M      number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed.
# %N      message score
# %n      author's real name (or address if missing)
# %O      original save folder where mutt would formerly have
#         stashed the message: list name or recipient name
#         if not sent to a list
# %P      progress indicator for the built-in pager (how much of the file has been displayed)
# %s      subject of the message
# %S      status of the message (``N''/``D''/``d''/``!''/``r''/*)
# %t      ``To:'' field (recipients)
# %T      the appropriate character from the $to_chars string
# %u      user (login) name of the author
# %v      first name of the author, or the recipient if the message is from you
# %X      number of attachments
#         (please see the ``attachments'' section for possible speed effects)
# %y      ``X-Label:'' field, if present
# %Y      ``X-Label:'' field, if present, and (1) not at part of a thread tree,
#         (2) at the top of a thread, or (3) ``X-Label:'' is different from
#         preceding message's ``X-Label:''.
# %Z      message status flags
# %{fmt}  the date and time of the message is converted to sender's
#         time zone, and ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function
#         strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %[fmt]  the date and time of the message is converted to the local
#         time zone, and ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function
#         strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %(fmt)  the local date and time when the message was received.
#         ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function strftime(3);
#         a leading bang disables locales
# %<fmt>  the current local time. ``fmt'' is expanded by the library
#         function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales.
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character ``X''
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character ``X''
# %*X     soft-fill with character ``X'' as pad
# 
# 
# ``Soft-fill'' deserves some explanation: Normal right-justification
# will print everything to the left of the ``%>'', displaying padding and
# whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
# soft-fill gives priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space
# to display it and showing padding only if there's still room. If
# necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for
# rightward text.
# 
# Note that these expandos are supported in
# ``save-hook'', ``fcc-hook'' and ``fcc-save-hook'', too.
# 
# 
# set ispell="ispell"
#
# Name: ispell
# Type: path
# Default: "ispell"
# 
# 
# How to invoke ispell (GNU's spell-checking software).
# 
# 
# set keep_flagged=no
#
# Name: keep_flagged
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, read messages marked as flagged will not be moved
# from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a result of
# a ``mbox-hook'' command.
# 
# 
# set locale="C"
#
# Name: locale
# Type: string
# Default: "C"
# 
# 
# The locale used by strftime(3) to format dates. Legal values are
# the strings your system accepts for the locale environment variable $LC_TIME.
# 
# 
# set mail_check=5
#
# Name: mail_check
# Type: number
# Default: 5
# 
# 
# This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt should look for
# new mail. Also see the $timeout variable.
# 
# 
# set mail_check_recent=yes
#
# Name: mail_check_recent
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will only notify you about new mail that has been received
# since the last time you opened the mailbox.  When unset, Mutt will notify you
# if any new mail exists in the mailbox, regardless of whether you have visited it
# recently.
# 
# When $mark_old is set, Mutt does not consider the mailbox to contain new
# mail if only old messages exist.
# 
# 
# set mailcap_path=""
#
# Name: mailcap_path
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which files to consult when attempting to
# display MIME bodies not directly supported by Mutt.
# 
# 
# set mailcap_sanitize=yes
#
# Name: mailcap_sanitize
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos
# to a well-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting,
# but we are not sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.
# 
# DON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE
# DOING!
# 
# 
# set maildir_header_cache_verify=yes
#
# Name: maildir_header_cache_verify
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Check for Maildir unaware programs other than mutt having modified maildir
# files when the header cache is in use.  This incurs one stat(2) per
# message every time the folder is opened (which can be very slow for NFS
# folders).
# 
# 
# set maildir_trash=no
#
# Name: maildir_trash
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir
# trashed flag instead of unlinked.  Note: this only applies
# to maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
# mailbox types.
# 
# 
# set mark_old=yes
#
# Name: mark_old
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not mutt marks new unread
# messages as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
# With this option set, the next time you start mutt, the messages
# will show up with an ``O'' next to them in the index menu,
# indicating that they are old.
# 
# 
# set markers=yes
#
# Name: markers
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a
# ``+'' marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines.
# 
# Also see the $smart_wrap variable.
# 
# 
# set mask="!^\\.[^.]"
#
# Name: mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "!^\\.[^.]"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by
# the not operator ``!''.  Only files whose names match this mask
# will be shown. The match is always case-sensitive.
# 
# 
# set mbox="~/mbox"
#
# Name: mbox
# Type: path
# Default: "~/mbox"
# 
# 
# This specifies the folder into which read mail in your $spoolfile
# folder will be appended.
# 
# Also see the $move variable.
# 
# 
# set mbox_type=mbox
#
# Name: mbox_type
# Type: folder magic
# Default: mbox
# 
# 
# The default mailbox type used when creating new folders. May be any of
# ``mbox'', ``MMDF'', ``MH'' and ``Maildir''. This is overridden by the
# -m command-line option.
# 
# 
# set menu_context=0
#
# Name: menu_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
# when scrolling through menus. (Similar to $pager_context.)
# 
# 
# set menu_move_off=yes
#
# Name: menu_move_off
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, the bottom entry of menus will never scroll up past
# the bottom of the screen, unless there are less entries than lines.
# When set, the bottom entry may move off the bottom.
# 
# 
# set menu_scroll=no
#
# Name: menu_scroll
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
# attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If unset, the screen
# is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
# (useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).
# 
# 
# set message_cache_clean=no
#
# Name: message_cache_clean
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will clean out obsolete entries from the message cache when
# the mailbox is synchronized. You probably only want to set it
# every once in a while, since it can be a little slow
# (especially for large folders).
# 
# 
# set message_cachedir=""
#
# Name: message_cachedir
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Set this to a directory and mutt will cache copies of messages from
# your IMAP and POP servers here. You are free to remove entries at any
# time.
# 
# When setting this variable to a directory, mutt needs to fetch every
# remote message only once and can perform regular expression searches
# as fast as for local folders.
# 
# Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.
# 
# 
# set message_format="%s"
#
# Name: message_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%s"
# 
# 
# This is the string displayed in the ``attachment'' menu for
# attachments of type message/rfc822.  For a full listing of defined
# printf(3)-like sequences see the section on $index_format.
# 
# 
# set meta_key=no
#
# Name: meta_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
# set as if the user had pressed the Esc key and whatever key remains
# after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
# has an ASCII value of 0xf8, then this is treated as if the user had
# pressed Esc then ``x''.  This is because the result of removing the
# high bit from 0xf8 is 0x78, which is the ASCII character
# ``x''.
# 
# 
# set metoo=no
#
# Name: metoo
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If unset, Mutt will remove your address (see the ``alternates''
# command) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.
# 
# 
# set mh_purge=no
#
# Name: mh_purge
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When unset, mutt will mimic mh's behavior and rename deleted messages
# to ,<old file name> in mh folders instead of really deleting
# them. This leaves the message on disk but makes programs reading the folder
# ignore it. If the variable is set, the message files will simply be
# deleted.
# 
# This option is similar to $maildir_trash for Maildir folders.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_flagged="flagged"
#
# Name: mh_seq_flagged
# Type: string
# Default: "flagged"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used for flagged messages.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_replied="replied"
#
# Name: mh_seq_replied
# Type: string
# Default: "replied"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied messages.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_unseen="unseen"
#
# Name: mh_seq_unseen
# Type: string
# Default: "unseen"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward=no
#
# Name: mime_forward
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
# separate message/rfc822 MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
# message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
# can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
# to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
# variable to ``ask-no'' or ``ask-yes''.
# 
# Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward_decode=no
#
# Name: mime_forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message while $mime_forward is set. Otherwise
# $forward_decode is used instead.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward_rest=yes
#
# Name: mime_forward_rest
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the attachment
# menu, attachments which cannot be decoded in a reasonable manner will
# be attached to the newly composed message if this option is set.
# 
# 
# set mix_entry_format="%4n %c %-16s %a"
#
# Name: mix_entry_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %c %-16s %a"
# 
# 
# This variable describes the format of a remailer line on the mixmaster
# chain selection screen.  The following printf(3)-like sequences are
# supported:
# %n      The running number on the menu.
# %c      Remailer capabilities.
# %s      The remailer's short name.
# %a      The remailer's e-mail address.
# 
# 
# set mixmaster="mixmaster"
#
# Name: mixmaster
# Type: path
# Default: "mixmaster"
# 
# 
# This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster binary on your
# system.  It is used with various sets of parameters to gather the
# list of known remailers, and to finally send a message through the
# mixmaster chain.
# 
# 
# set move=no
#
# Name: move
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt will move read messages
# from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a result of
# a ``mbox-hook'' command.
# 
# 
# set narrow_tree=no
#
# Name: narrow_tree
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable, when set, makes the thread tree narrower, allowing
# deeper threads to fit on the screen.
# 
# 
# set net_inc=10
#
# Name: net_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# Operations that expect to transfer a large amount of data over the
# network will update their progress every $net_inc kilobytes.
# If set to 0, no progress messages will be displayed.
# 
# See also $read_inc, $write_inc and $net_inc.
# 
# 
# set pager="builtin"
#
# Name: pager
# Type: path
# Default: "builtin"
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
# messages. The value ``builtin'' means to use the built-in pager, otherwise this
# variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
# like to use.
# 
# Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional
# keystrokes are necessary because you can't call mutt functions
# directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer than
# the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.
# 
# 
# set pager_context=0
#
# Name: pager_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
# when displaying the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By
# default, Mutt will display the line after the last one on the screen
# at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).
# 
# This variable also specifies the amount of context given for search
# results. If positive, this many lines will be given before a match,
# if 0, the match will be top-aligned.
# 
# 
# set pager_format="-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s%*  -- (%P)"
#
# Name: pager_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s%*  -- (%P)"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the format of the one-line message ``status''
# displayed before each message in either the internal or an external
# pager.  The valid sequences are listed in the $index_format
# section.
# 
# 
# set pager_index_lines=0
#
# Name: pager_index_lines
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
# the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
# folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
# giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
# message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
# remain to be read in the current thread.  One of the lines is reserved
# for the status bar from the index, so a setting of 6
# will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value of 0 results in
# no index being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder
# is less than $pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as
# many lines as it needs.
# 
# 
# set pager_stop=no
#
# Name: pager_stop
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the internal-pager will not move to the next message
# when you are at the end of a message and invoke the <next-page>
# function.
# 
# 
# set pgp_auto_decode=no
#
# Name: pgp_auto_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will automatically attempt to decrypt traditional PGP
# messages whenever the user performs an operation which ordinarily would
# result in the contents of the message being operated on.  For example,
# if the user displays a pgp-traditional message which has not been manually
# checked with the <check-traditional-pgp> function, mutt will automatically
# check the message for traditional pgp.
# 
# 
# set pgp_autoinline=no
#
# Name: pgp_autoinline
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style inline
# (traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain
# circumstances.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp menu,
# when inline is not required.
# 
# Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
# which consist of more than a single MIME part.  Mutt can be
# configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
# (traditional) would not work.
# 
# Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.
# 
# Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is strongly
# deprecated.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_check_exit=yes
#
# Name: pgp_check_exit
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will check the exit code of the PGP subprocess when
# signing or encrypting.  A non-zero exit code means that the
# subprocess failed.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_clearsign_command=""
#
# Name: pgp_clearsign_command
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This format is used to create an old-style ``clearsigned'' PGP
# message.  Note that the use of this format is strongly
# deprecated.
# 
# This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
# possible printf(3)-like sequences.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_decode_command=""
#
# Name: pgp_decode_command
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This format strings specifies a command which is used to decode
# application/pgp attachments.
# 
# The PGP command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like sequences:
# %p      Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to an empty
#         string otherwise. Note: This may be used with a %? construct.
# %f      Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
# %s      Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
#                    of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
# %a      The value of $pgp_sign_as.
# %r      One or more key IDs.
# 
# 
# For examples on how to configure these formats for the various versions

# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the PGP key selection menu to

# set pgp_getkeys_command=""
#
# Name: pgp_getkeys_command
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This command is invoked whenever mutt will need public key information.
# Of the sequences supported by $pgp_decode_command, %r is the only
# printf(3)-like sequence used with this format.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_good_sign=""
#
# Name: pgp_good_sign
# Type: regular expression
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If you assign a text to this variable, then a PGP signature is only

# 
# 
# set pgp_ignore_subkeys=yes
#
# Name: pgp_ignore_subkeys
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes

# set pgp_list_secring_command=""
#
# Name: pgp_list_secring_command
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This command is used to list the secret key ring's contents.  The
# output format must be analogous to the one used by:
# gpg --list-keys --with-colons.
# 
# This format is also generated by the pgpring utility which comes
# with mutt.
# 
# This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for

# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_long_ids=no
#
# Name: pgp_long_ids

# 
# 
# set pgp_mime_auto=ask-yes
#
# Name: pgp_mime_auto
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# This option controls whether Mutt will prompt you for
# automatically sending a (signed/encrypted) message using
# PGP/MIME when inline (traditional) fails (for any reason).
# 
# Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is strongly
# deprecated.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_replyinline=no
#
# Name: pgp_replyinline
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to
# create an inline (traditional) message when replying to a
# message which is PGP encrypted/signed inline.  This can be
# overridden by use of the pgp menu, when inline is not
# required.  This option does not automatically detect if the
# (replied-to) message is inline; instead it relies on Mutt
# internals for previously checked/flagged messages.
# 
# Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
# which consist of more than a single MIME part.  Mutt can be
# configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
# (traditional) would not work.
# 
# Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.

#
# Name: pgp_retainable_sigs
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, signed and encrypted messages will consist of nested
# multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body parts.
# 
# This is useful for applications like encrypted and signed mailing
# lists, where the outer layer (multipart/encrypted) can be easily
# removed, while the inner multipart/signed part is retained.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_show_unusable=yes
#
# Name: pgp_show_unusable
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes

# 
# set pgp_sign_as=""
#
# Name: pgp_sign_as
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If you have more than one key pair, this option allows you to specify

# 
# 
# set pgp_strict_enc=yes
#
# Name: pgp_strict_enc
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as

# this if you know what you are doing.
# (PGP only)
# 
# 
# set pgp_timeout=300
#
# Name: pgp_timeout

# set pipe_decode=no
#
# Name: pipe_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#

# first.
# 
# 
# set pipe_sep="\n"
#
# Name: pipe_sep
# Type: string
# Default: "\n"
# 
# 
# The separator to add between messages when piping a list of tagged

# 
# 
# set pipe_split=no
#
# Name: pipe_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Used in connection with the <pipe-message> function following
# <tag-prefix>.  If this variable is unset, when piping a list of
# tagged messages Mutt will concatenate the messages and will pipe them
# all concatenated.  When set, Mutt will pipe the messages one by one.
# In both cases the messages are piped in the current sorted order,
# and the $pipe_sep separator is added after each message.
# 
# 
# set pop_auth_try_all=yes
#
# Name: pop_auth_try_all
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will try all available authentication methods.
# When unset, Mutt will only fall back to other authentication
# methods if the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is
# available but authentication fails, Mutt will not connect to the POP server.
# 
# 
# set pop_authenticators=""
#
# Name: pop_authenticators
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an POP server, in the order mutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are either ``user'', ``apop'' or any
# SASL mechanism, e.g. ``digest-md5'', ``gssapi'' or ``cram-md5''.
# This option is case-insensitive. If this option is unset
# (the default) mutt will try all available methods, in order from
# most-secure to least-secure.
# 
# Example:
# set pop_authenticators="digest-md5:apop:user"
# 
# 
# set pop_checkinterval=60
#
# Name: pop_checkinterval
# Type: number
# Default: 60

# This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt should look for
# new mail in the currently selected mailbox if it is a POP mailbox.
# 
# 
# set pop_delete=ask-no
#
# Name: pop_delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will delete successfully downloaded messages from the POP

# download messages but also leave them on the POP server.
# 
# 
# set pop_host=""
#
# Name: pop_host
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# The name of your POP server for the <fetch-mail> function.  You
# can also specify an alternative port, username and password, i.e.:

# 
# where ``[...]'' denotes an optional part.
# 
# 
# set pop_last=no
#
# Name: pop_last
# Type: boolean
# Default: no

# If this variable is set, mutt will try to use the ``LAST'' POP command
# for retrieving only unread messages from the POP server when using
# the <fetch-mail> function.
# 
# 
# set pop_pass=""
#
# Name: pop_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the password for your POP account.  If unset, Mutt will
# prompt you for your password when you open a POP mailbox.
# 
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc
# even if you are the only one who can read the file.
# 
# 
# set pop_reconnect=ask-yes
#
# Name: pop_reconnect
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt will try to reconnect to the POP server if
# the connection is lost.
# 
# 
# set pop_user=""
#
# Name: pop_user
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Your login name on the POP server.
# 
# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
# 
# 
# set post_indent_string=""
#
# Name: post_indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Similar to the $attribution variable, Mutt will append this
# string after the inclusion of a message which is being replied to.
# 
# 
# set postpone=ask-yes
#
# Name: postpone
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not messages are saved in the $postponed
# mailbox when you elect not to send immediately.
# 
# Also see the $recall variable.
# 
# 
# set postponed="~/postponed"
#
# Name: postponed
# Type: path
# Default: "~/postponed"
# 
# 
# Mutt allows you to indefinitely ``postpone sending a message'' which
# you are editing.  When you choose to postpone a message, Mutt saves it
# in the mailbox specified by this variable.
# 
# Also see the $postpone variable.
# 
# 
# set preconnect=""
#
# Name: preconnect
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If set, a shell command to be executed if mutt fails to establish
# a connection to the server. This is useful for setting up secure
# connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the command returns a  nonzero
# status, mutt gives up opening the server. Example:
# set preconnect="ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net \
# sleep 20 < /dev/null > /dev/null"
# 
# Mailbox ``foo'' on ``mailhost.net'' can now be reached
# as ``{localhost:1234}foo''.
# 
# Note: For this example to work, you must be able to log in to the
# remote machine without having to enter a password.
# 
# 
# set print=ask-no
#
# Name: print
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt really prints messages.
# This is set to ``ask-no'' by default, because some people
# accidentally hit ``p'' often.
# 
# 
# set print_command="lpr"
#
# Name: print_command
# Type: path
# Default: "lpr"
# 
# 
# This specifies the command pipe that should be used to print messages.
# 
# 
# set print_decode=yes
#
# Name: print_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Used in connection with the <print-message> command.  If this
# option is set, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
# external command specified by $print_command.  If this option
# is unset, no processing will be applied to the message when
# printing it.  The latter setting may be useful if you are using
# some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format
# e-mail messages for printing.
# 
# 
# set print_split=no
#
# Name: print_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Used in connection with the <print-message> command.  If this option
# is set, the command specified by $print_command is executed once for
# each message which is to be printed.  If this option is unset,
# the command specified by $print_command is executed only once, and
# all the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the message
# separator.
# 
# Those who use the enscript(1) program's mail-printing mode will
# most likely want to set this option.
# 
# 
# set prompt_after=yes
#
# Name: prompt_after
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If you use an external $pager, setting this variable will
# cause Mutt to prompt you for a command when the pager exits rather
# than returning to the index menu.  If unset, Mutt will return to the
# index menu when the external pager exits.
# 
# 
# set query_command=""
#
# Name: query_command
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This specifies the command Mutt will use to make external address
# queries.  The string may contain a ``%s'', which will be substituted
# with the query string the user types.  Mutt will add quotes around the
# string substituted for ``%s'' automatically according to shell quoting
# rules, so you should avoid adding your own.  If no ``%s'' is found in
# the string, Mutt will append the user's query to the end of the string.
# See ``query'' for more information.
# 
# 
# set query_format="%4c %t %-25.25a %-25.25n %?e?(%e)?"
#
# Name: query_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4c %t %-25.25a %-25.25n %?e?(%e)?"
# 
# 
# This variable describes the format of the ``query'' menu. The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are understood:
# %a      destination address
# %c      current entry number
# %e      extra information *
# %n      destination name
# %t      ``*'' if current entry is tagged, a space otherwise
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with ``X''
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with ``X''
# %*X     soft-fill with character ``X'' as pad
# 
# 
# For an explanation of ``soft-fill'', see the $index_format documentation.
# 
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero, see the $status_format documentation.
# 
# 
# set quit=yes
#
# Name: quit
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether ``quit'' and ``exit'' actually quit
# from mutt.  If this option is set, they do quit, if it is unset, they
# have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes or ask-no, you are
# prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.
# 
# 
# set quote_regexp="^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"
#
# Name: quote_regexp
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used in the internal pager to determine quoted
# sections of text in the body of a message. Quoted text may be filtered
# out using the <toggle-quoted> command, or colored according to the
# ``color quoted'' family of directives.
# 
# Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently (``color quoted1'',
# ``color quoted2'', etc.). The quoting level is determined by removing
# the last character from the matched text and recursively reapplying
# the regular expression until it fails to produce a match.
# 
# Match detection may be overridden by the $smileys regular expression.
# 
# 
# set read_inc=10
#
# Name: read_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display which message it
# is currently on when reading a mailbox or when performing search actions
# such as search and limit. The message is printed after
# this many messages have been read or searched (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will
# print a message when it is at message 25, and then again when it gets
# to message 50).  This variable is meant to indicate progress when
# reading or searching large mailboxes which may take some time.
# When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
# the mailbox.
# 
# Also see the $write_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
# ``tuning'' section of the manual for performance considerations.
# 
# 
# set read_only=no
#
# Name: read_only
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.
# 
# 
# set realname=""
#
# Name: realname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies what ``real'' or ``personal'' name should be used
# when sending messages.
# 
# By default, this is the GECOS field from /etc/passwd.  Note that this
# variable will not be used when the user has set a real name
# in the $from variable.
# 
# 
# set recall=ask-yes
#
# Name: recall
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt recalls postponed messages
# when composing a new message.
# 
# Setting this variable to is not generally useful, and thus not
# recommended.
# 
# Also see $postponed variable.
# 
# 
# set record="~/sent"
#
# Name: record
# Type: path
# Default: "~/sent"
# 
# 
# This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
# appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of
# your messages, but another way to do this is using the ``my_hdr''
# command to create a ``Bcc:'' field with your email address in it.)
# 
# The value of $record is overridden by the $force_name and
# $save_name variables, and the ``fcc-hook'' command.
# 
# 
# set reply_regexp="^(re([\\[0-9\\]+])*|aw):[ \t]*"
#
# Name: reply_regexp
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^(re([\\[0-9\\]+])*|aw):[ \t]*"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading
# and replying. The default value corresponds to the English "Re:" and
# the German "Aw:".
# 
# 
# set reply_self=no
#
# Name: reply_self
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt will
# assume that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather
# than to yourself.
# 
# Also see the ``alternates'' command.
# 
# 
# set reply_to=ask-yes
#
# Name: reply_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# If set, when replying to a message, Mutt will use the address listed
# in the Reply-to: header as the recipient of the reply.  If unset,
# it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
# option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
# header field to the list address and you want to send a private
# message to the author of a message.
# 
# 
# set resolve=yes
#
# Name: resolve
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
# (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the
# current message is executed.
# 
# 
# set reverse_alias=no
#
# Name: reverse_alias
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the ``personal''
# name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
# matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
# alias:
# alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)
# 
# and then you receive mail which contains the following header:
# From: abd30425@somewhere.net
# 
# It would be displayed in the index menu as ``Joe User'' instead of
# ``abd30425@somewhere.net.''  This is useful when the person's e-mail
# address is not human friendly.
# 
# 
# set reverse_name=no
#
# Name: reverse_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
# move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
# from there.  If this variable is set, the default From: line of
# the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
# messages you are replying to if that address matches your
# ``alternates''.  If the variable is unset, or the address that would be
# used doesn't match your ``alternates'', the From: line will use
# your address on the current machine.
# 
# Also see the ``alternates'' command.
# 
# 
# set reverse_realname=yes
#
# Name: reverse_realname
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable fine-tunes the behavior of the $reverse_name feature.
# When it is set, mutt will use the address from incoming messages as-is,
# possibly including eventual real names.  When it is unset, mutt will
# override any such real names with the setting of the $realname variable.
# 
# 
# set rfc2047_parameters=no
#
# Name: rfc2047_parameters
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, Mutt will decode RFC2047-encoded MIME
# parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt suggests you
# to save attachments to files named like:
# =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
# 
# When this variable is set interactively, the change won't be
# active until you change folders.
# 
# Note that this use of RFC2047's encoding is explicitly
# prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
# wild.
# 
# Also note that setting this parameter will not have the effect
# that mutt generates this kind of encoding.  Instead, mutt will
# unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.
# 
# 
# set save_address=no
#
# Name: save_address
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
# default folder for saving a mail. If $save_name or $force_name
# is set too, the selection of the Fcc folder will be changed as well.
# 
# 
# set save_empty=yes
#
# Name: save_empty
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
# when closed (the exception is $spoolfile which is never removed).
# If set, mailboxes are never removed.
# 
# Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt does not
# delete MH and Maildir directories.
# 
# 
# set save_history=0
#
# Name: save_history
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# This variable controls the size of the history (per category) saved in the
# $history_file file.
# 
# 
# set save_name=no
#
# Name: save_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
# When set, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
# recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
# the $folder directory with the username part of the
# recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
# be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
# $record mailbox.
# 
# Also see the $force_name variable.
# 
# 
# set score=yes
#
# Name: score
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off.  This can
# be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
# $score_threshold_delete variable and related are used.
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_delete=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_delete
# Type: number
# Default: -1
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by mutt.  Since
# mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_flag=9999
#
# Name: score_threshold_flag
# Type: number
# Default: 9999
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this
# variable's value are automatically marked "flagged".
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_read=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_read
# Type: number
# Default: -1
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked as read by mutt.  Since
# mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message read.
# 
# 
# set search_context=0
#
# Name: search_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# For the pager, this variable specifies the number of lines shown
# before search results. By default, search results will be top-aligned.
# 
# 
# set send_charset="us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"
#
# Name: send_charset
# Type: string
# Default: "us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"

# 
# A colon-delimited list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the
# first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
# If your $charset is not ``iso-8859-1'' and recipients may not
# understand ``UTF-8'', it is advisable to include in the list an
# appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
# ``iso-8859-2'', ``koi8-r'' or ``iso-2022-jp'') either instead of or after
# ``iso-8859-1''.
# 
# In case the text cannot be converted into one of these exactly,
# mutt uses $charset as a fallback.
# 
# 
# set sendmail="/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"
#
# Name: sendmail
# Type: path
# Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"
# 
# 
# Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt.
# Mutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
# arguments as recipient addresses.
# 
# 
# set sendmail_wait=0
#
# Name: sendmail_wait
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the $sendmail process
# to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.
# 
# Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
# >0      number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
# 0       wait forever for sendmail to finish
# <0      always put sendmail in the background without waiting
# 
# 
# Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child
# process will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you
# will be informed as to where to find the output.
# 
# 
# set shell=""
#
# Name: shell
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Command to use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user's login
# shell from /etc/passwd is used.
# 
# 
# set sig_dashes=yes
#
# Name: sig_dashes
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, a line containing ``-- '' (note the trailing space) will be inserted before your
# $signature.  It is strongly recommended that you not unset
# this variable unless your signature contains just your name.  The
# reason for this is because many software packages use ``-- \n'' to
# detect your signature.  For example, Mutt has the ability to highlight
# the signature in a different color in the built-in pager.
# 
# 
# set sig_on_top=no
#
# Name: sig_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
# text.  It is strongly recommended that you do not set this variable
# unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
# some heat from netiquette guardians.
# 
# 
# set signature="~/.signature"
#
# Name: signature
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.signature"
# 
# 
# Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
# outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is
# assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
# its standard output.
# 
# 
# set simple_search="~f %s | ~s %s"
#
# Name: simple_search
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s | ~s %s"
# 
# 
# Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a real search
# pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the ``~'' pattern
# operators.  See ``patterns'' for more information on search patterns.
# 
# For example, if you simply type ``joe'' at a search or limit prompt, Mutt
# will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable by
# replacing ``%s'' with the supplied string.
# For the default value, ``joe'' would be expanded to: ``~f joe | ~s joe''.
# 
# 
# set sleep_time=1
#
# Name: sleep_time
# Type: number
# Default: 1
# 
# 
# Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
# messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging
# messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so
# a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.
# 
# 
# set smart_wrap=yes
#
# Name: smart_wrap
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the display of lines longer than the screen width in the
# internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If
# unset, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
# $markers variable.
# 
# 
# set smileys="(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
#
# Name: smileys
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
# 
# 
# The pager uses this variable to catch some common false
# positives of $quote_regexp, most notably smileys and not consider
# a line quoted text if it also matches $smileys. This mostly
# happens at the beginning of a line.
# 
# 
# set smime_ask_cert_label=yes
#
# Name: smime_ask_cert_label
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This flag controls whether you want to be asked to enter a label
# for a certificate about to be added to the database or not. It is
# set by default.
# (S/MIME only)
# 
# 
# set smime_ca_location=""
#
# Name: smime_ca_location

# contains trusted certificates for use with OpenSSL.
# (S/MIME only)
# 
# 
# set smime_certificates=""
#
# Name: smime_certificates
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, mutt has to handle
# storage and retrieval of keys by itself. This is very basic right
# now, and keys and certificates are stored in two different
# directories, both named as the hash-value retrieved from
# OpenSSL. There is an index file which contains mailbox-address
# keyid pairs, and which can be manually edited. This option points to
# the location of the certificates.
# (S/MIME only)
# 
# 
# set smime_decrypt_command=""
#
# Name: smime_decrypt_command
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This format string specifies a command which is used to decrypt
# application/x-pkcs7-mime attachments.
# 
# The OpenSSL command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like sequences
# similar to PGP's:
# %f      Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
# %s      Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
#                    of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
# %k      The key-pair specified with $smime_default_key
# %c      One or more certificate IDs.
# %a      The algorithm used for encryption.
# %C      CA location:  Depending on whether $smime_ca_location
#                    points to a directory or file, this expands to
#                    ``-CApath $smime_ca_location'' or ``-CAfile $smime_ca_location''.

# set smime_decrypt_use_default_key=yes
#
# Name: smime_decrypt_use_default_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set (default) this tells mutt to use the default key for decryption. Otherwise,
# if managing multiple certificate-key-pairs, mutt will try to use the mailbox-address
# to determine the key to use. It will ask you to supply a key, if it can't find one.
# (S/MIME only)

# 
# set smime_default_key=""
#
# Name: smime_default_key
# Type: string

# set smime_is_default=no
#
# Name: smime_is_default
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# The default behavior of mutt is to use PGP on all auto-sign/encryption
# operations. To override and to use OpenSSL instead this must be set.
# However, this has no effect while replying, since mutt will automatically

# 
# set smtp_authenticators=""
#
# Name: smtp_authenticators
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an SMTP server, in the order mutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are any SASL mechanism, e.g.
# ``digest-md5'', ``gssapi'' or ``cram-md5''.
# This option is case-insensitive. If it is ``unset''
# (the default) mutt will try all available methods, in order from
# most-secure to least-secure.
# 
# Example:
# set smtp_authenticators="digest-md5:cram-md5"
# 
# 
# set smtp_pass=""
#
# Name: smtp_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the password for your SMTP account.  If unset, Mutt will
# prompt you for your password when you first send mail via SMTP.
# See $smtp_url to configure mutt to send mail via SMTP.
# 
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even
# if you are the only one who can read the file.
# 
# 
# set smtp_url=""
#
# Name: smtp_url
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Defines the SMTP smarthost where sent messages should relayed for
# delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:
# smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]
# 
# where ``[...]'' denotes an optional part.
# Setting this variable overrides the value of the $sendmail
# variable.
# 
# 
# set sort=date
#
# Name: sort
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
# 
# 
# Specifies how to sort messages in the ``index'' menu.  Valid values
# are:
# - date or date-sent
# - date-received
# - from
# - mailbox-order (unsorted)
# - score
# - size
# - spam
# - subject
# - threads
# - to
# 
# 
# You may optionally use the ``reverse-'' prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: ``set sort=reverse-date-sent'').
# 
# 
# set sort_alias=alias
#
# Name: sort_alias
# Type: sort order
# Default: alias
# 
# 
# Specifies how the entries in the ``alias'' menu are sorted.  The
# following are legal values:
# - address (sort alphabetically by email address)
# - alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
# - unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)
# 
# 
# set sort_aux=date
#
# Name: sort_aux
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
# 
# 
# When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
# in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
# are sorted.  This can be set to any value that $sort can, except
# ``threads'' (in that case, mutt will just use ``date-sent'').  You can also
# specify the ``last-'' prefix in addition to the ``reverse-'' prefix, but ``last-''
# must come after ``reverse-''.  The ``last-'' prefix causes messages to be
# sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
# the rest of $sort_aux as an ordering.  For instance,
# set sort_aux=last-date-received
# 
# would mean that if a new message is received in a
# thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
# you have ``set sort=reverse-threads''.)
# 
# Note: For reversed $sort
# order $sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
# but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).
# 
# 
# set sort_browser=alpha
#
# Name: sort_browser
# Type: sort order
# Default: alpha
# 
# 
# Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.  By default, the
# entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:
# - alpha (alphabetically)
# - date
# - size
# - unsorted
# 
# 
# You may optionally use the ``reverse-'' prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: ``set sort_browser=reverse-date'').
# 
# 
# set sort_re=yes
#
# Name: sort_re
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
# $strict_threads unset.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
# mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With $sort_re set, mutt will
# only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
# the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
# setting of $reply_regexp.  With $sort_re unset, mutt will attach
# the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
# non-$reply_regexp parts of both messages are identical.
# 
# 
# set spam_separator=","
#
# Name: spam_separator
# Type: string
# Default: ","
# 
# 
# This variable controls what happens when multiple spam headers
# are matched: if unset, each successive header will overwrite any
# previous matches value for the spam label. If set, each successive
# match will append to the previous, using this variable's value as a
# separator.
# 
# 
# set spoolfile=""
#
# Name: spoolfile
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot find
# it, you can specify its location with this variable.  Mutt will
# initially set this variable to the value of the environment
# variable $MAIL or $MAILDIR if either is defined.
# 
# 
# set ssl_ca_certificates_file=""
#
# Name: ssl_ca_certificates_file
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA certificates.
# Any server certificate that is signed with one of these CA
# certificates is also automatically accepted.
# 
# Example:
# set ssl_ca_certificates_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
# 
# 
# set ssl_client_cert=""
#
# Name: ssl_client_cert
# Type: path
# Default: ""

# 
# The file containing a client certificate and its associated private
# key.
# 
# 
# set ssl_force_tls=no
#
# Name: ssl_force_tls
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If this variable is set, Mutt will require that all connections
# to remote servers be encrypted. Furthermore it will attempt to
# negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the capability,
# since it would otherwise have to abort the connection anyway. This
# option supersedes $ssl_starttls.
# 
# 
# set ssl_min_dh_prime_bits=0
#
# Name: ssl_min_dh_prime_bits
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# This variable specifies the minimum acceptable prime size (in bits)
# for use in any Diffie-Hellman key exchange. A value of 0 will use
# the default from the GNUTLS library.
# 
# 
# set ssl_starttls=yes
#
# Name: ssl_starttls
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set (the default), mutt will attempt to use STARTTLS on servers
# advertising the capability. When unset, mutt will not attempt to
# use STARTTLS regardless of the server's capabilities.
# 
# 
# set ssl_use_sslv2=no
#
# Name: ssl_use_sslv2
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable specifies whether to attempt to use SSLv2 in the
# SSL authentication process.
# 
# 
# set ssl_use_sslv3=yes
#
# Name: ssl_use_sslv3
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable specifies whether to attempt to use SSLv3 in the
# SSL authentication process.
# 
# 
# set ssl_use_tlsv1=yes
#
# Name: ssl_use_tlsv1
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable specifies whether to attempt to use TLSv1 in the
# SSL authentication process.
# 
# 
# set ssl_usesystemcerts=yes
#
# Name: ssl_usesystemcerts
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set to yes, mutt will use CA certificates in the
# system-wide certificate store when checking if a server certificate
# is signed by a trusted CA.
# 
# 
# set ssl_verify_dates=yes
#
# Name: ssl_verify_dates
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set (the default), mutt will not automatically accept a server
# certificate that is either not yet valid or already expired. You should
# only unset this for particular known hosts, using the
# <account-hook> function.
# 
# 
# set ssl_verify_host=yes
#
# Name: ssl_verify_host
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set (the default), mutt will not automatically accept a server
# certificate whose host name does not match the host used in your folder
# URL. You should only unset this for particular known hosts, using
# the <account-hook> function.
# 
# 
# set status_chars="-*%A"
#
# Name: status_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "-*%A"
# 
# 
# Controls the characters used by the ``%r'' indicator in
# $status_format. The first character is used when the mailbox is
# unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox has been changed, and
# it needs to be resynchronized. The third is used if the mailbox is in
# read-only mode, or if the mailbox will not be written when exiting
# that mailbox (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
# with the <toggle-write> operation, bound by default to ``%''). The fourth
# is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened in attach-
# message mode (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying,
# forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).
# 
# 
# set status_format="-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"

# 
# 
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the ``index''
# menu.  This string is similar to $index_format, but has its own

# %s      current sorting mode ($sort)
# %S      current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
# %t      number of tagged messages *
# %u      number of unread messages *
# %v      Mutt version string
# %V      currently active limit pattern, if any *
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with ``X''
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with ``X''
# %*X     soft-fill with character ``X'' as pad
# 
# 
# For an explanation of ``soft-fill'', see the $index_format documentation.
# 
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero
# 
# Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
# if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
# number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
# particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
# of the above sequences, the following construct is used:
# 
# %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?
# 
# where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and
# optional_string is the string you would like printed if
# sequence_char is nonzero.  optional_string may contain
# other sequences as well as normal text, but you may not nest
# optional strings.
# 
# Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
# new messages in a mailbox:
# 
# %?n?%n new messages.?
# 
# You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
# 
# %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?
# 
# If the value of sequence_char is non-zero, if_string will
# be expanded, otherwise else_string will be expanded.
# 
# You can force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence to be lowercase
# by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore (``_'') sign.
# For example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase,
# you would use: ``%_h''.
# 
# If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (``:'') character, mutt
# will replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful
# with IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.
# 
# 
# set status_on_top=no
#
# Name: status_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable causes the ``status bar'' to be displayed on
# the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom. If $help
# is set, too it'll be placed at the bottom.
# 
# 
# set strict_threads=no
#
# Name: strict_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, threading will only make use of the ``In-Reply-To'' and
# ``References:'' fields when you $sort by message threads.  By
# default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
# ``pseudo threads.''. This may not always be desirable, such as in a
# personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
# the subjects like ``hi'' which will get grouped together. See also
# $sort_re for a less drastic way of controlling this
# behavior.
# 
# 
# set suspend=yes
#
# Name: suspend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, mutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
# susp key, usually ``^Z''. This is useful if you run mutt
# inside an xterm using a command like ``xterm -e mutt''.
# 
# 
# set text_flowed=no
#
# Name: text_flowed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will generate ``format=flowed'' bodies with a content type
# of ``text/plain; format=flowed''.
# This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
# just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's
# features, you'll need support in your editor.
# 
# Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is set.
# 
# 
# set thorough_search=yes
#
# Name: thorough_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in
# section ``patterns''.  If set, the headers and body/attachments of
# messages to be searched are decoded before searching. If unset,
# messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
# 
# Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters should set
# this value because decoding also includes MIME parsing/decoding and possible
# character set conversions. Otherwise mutt will attempt to match against the
# raw message received (for example quoted-printable encoded or with encoded
# headers) which may lead to incorrect search results.
# 
# 
# set thread_received=no
#
# Name: thread_received
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
# to thread messages by subject.
# 
# 
# set tilde=no
#
# Name: tilde
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
# screen with a tilde (``~'').
# 
# 
# set time_inc=0
#
# Name: time_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Along with $read_inc, $write_inc, and $net_inc, this
# variable controls the frequency with which progress updates are
# displayed. It suppresses updates less than $time_inc milliseconds
# apart. This can improve throughput on systems with slow terminals,
# or when running mutt on a remote system.
# 
# Also see the ``tuning'' section of the manual for performance considerations.
# 
# 
# set timeout=600
#
# Name: timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 600
# 
# 
# When Mutt is waiting for user input either idling in menus or
# in an interactive prompt, Mutt would block until input is
# present. Depending on the context, this would prevent certain
# operations from working, like checking for new mail or keeping
# an IMAP connection alive.
# 
# This variable controls how many seconds Mutt will at most wait
# until it aborts waiting for input, performs these operations and
# continues to wait for input.
# 
# A value of zero or less will cause Mutt to never time out.
# 
# 
# set tmpdir=""
#
# Name: tmpdir
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its
# temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.  If
# this variable is not set, the environment variable $TMPDIR is
# used.  If $TMPDIR is not set then ``/tmp'' is used.
# 
# 
# set to_chars=" +TCFL"
#
# Name: to_chars
# Type: string
# Default: " +TCFL"
# 
# 
# Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.  The
# first character is the one used when the mail is not addressed to your
# address.  The second is used when you are the only
# recipient of the message.  The third is when your address
# appears in the ``To:'' header field, but you are not the only recipient of
# the message.  The fourth character is used when your
# address is specified in the ``Cc:'' header field, but you are not the only
# recipient.  The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent
# by you.  The sixth character is used to indicate when a mail
# was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to.
# 
# 
# set tunnel=""
#
# Name: tunnel
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a command
# instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
# preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. Example:
# set tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"
# 
# Note: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
# machine without having to enter a password.
# 
# When set, Mutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.
# Please see ``account-hook'' in the manual for how to use different
# tunnel commands per connection.
# 
# 
# set uncollapse_jump=no
#
# Name: uncollapse_jump
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
# when the current thread is uncollapsed.
# 
# 
# set use_8bitmime=no
#
# Name: use_8bitmime
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Warning: do not set this variable unless you are using a version
# of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail
# 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
# 
# When set, Mutt will invoke $sendmail with the -B8BITMIME
# flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.
# 
# 
# set use_domain=yes
#
# Name: use_domain
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
# ``@host'' portion) with the value of $hostname.  If unset, no
# addresses will be qualified.
# 
# 
# set use_envelope_from=no
#
# Name: use_envelope_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will set the envelope sender of the message.
# If $envelope_from_address is set, it will be used as the sender
# address. If unset, mutt will attempt to derive the sender from the
# ``From:'' header.
# 
# Note that this information is passed to sendmail command using the
# -f command line switch. Therefore setting this option is not useful
# if the $sendmail variable already contains -f or if the
# executable pointed to by $sendmail doesn't support the -f switch.
# 
# 
# set use_from=yes
#
# Name: use_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will generate the ``From:'' header field when
# sending messages.  If unset, no ``From:'' header field will be
# generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the ``my_hdr''
# command.
# 
# 
# set use_idn=yes
#
# Name: use_idn
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will show you international domain names decoded.
# Note: You can use IDNs for addresses even if this is unset.
# This variable only affects decoding.
# 
# 
# set use_ipv6=yes
#
# Name: use_ipv6
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
# contact.  If this option is unset, Mutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
# Normally, the default should work.
# 
# 
# set user_agent=yes
#
# Name: user_agent
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will add a ``User-Agent:'' header to outgoing
# messages, indicating which version of mutt was used for composing
# them.
# 
# 
# set visual=""
#
# Name: visual
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the ``~v'' command is
# given in the built-in editor.
# 
# 
# set wait_key=yes
#
# Name: wait_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after an external command
# has been invoked by these functions: <shell-escape>,
# <pipe-message>, <pipe-entry>, <print-message>,
# and <print-entry> commands.
# 
# It is also used when viewing attachments with ``auto_view'', provided
# that the corresponding mailcap entry has a needsterminal flag,
# and the external program is interactive.
# 
# When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When unset, Mutt will wait
# for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.
# 
# 
# set weed=yes
#
# Name: weed
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will weed headers when displaying, forwarding,
# printing, or replying to messages.
# 
# 
# set wrap=0
#
# Name: wrap
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# When set to a positive value, mutt will wrap text at $wrap characters.
# When set to a negative value, mutt will wrap text so that there are $wrap
# characters of empty space on the right side of the terminal. Setting it
# to zero makes mutt wrap at the terminal width.
# 
# 
# set wrap_headers=78
#
# Name: wrap_headers
# Type: number
# Default: 78
# 
# 
# This option specifies the number of characters to use for wrapping
# an outgoing message's headers. Allowed values are between 78 and 998
# inclusive.
# 
# Note: This option usually shouldn't be changed. RFC5233
# recommends a line length of 78 (the default), so please only change
# this setting when you know what you're doing.
# 
# 
# set wrap_search=yes
#
# Name: wrap_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether searches wrap around the end.
# 
# When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) item. When
# unset, incremental searches will not wrap.
# 
# 
# set wrapmargin=0
#
# Name: wrapmargin
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# (DEPRECATED) Equivalent to setting $wrap with a negative value.
# 
# 
# set write_bcc=yes
#
# Name: write_bcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether mutt writes out the ``Bcc:'' header when preparing
# messages to be sent.  Exim users may wish to unset this. If mutt
# is set to deliver directly via SMTP (see $smtp_url), this
# option does nothing: mutt will never write out the ``Bcc:'' header
# in this case.
# 
# 
# set write_inc=10
#
# Name: write_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
# $write_inc messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a
# single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.
# 
# Also see the $read_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
# ``tuning'' section of the manual for performance considerations.
