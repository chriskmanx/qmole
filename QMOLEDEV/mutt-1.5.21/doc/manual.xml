<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Mutt</emphasis> is a small but very powerful
text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt is highly configurable, and is well
suited to the mail power user with advanced features like key bindings,
keyboard macros, mail threading, regular expression searches and a
powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of messages.

<chapter id="gettingstarted">
<title>Getting Started</title>

<para>
This section is intended as a brief overview of how to use Mutt.  There
are many other features which are described elsewhere in the manual.
There is even more information available in the Mutt FAQ and various web
pages. See the <ulink url="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt homepage</ulink>
for more details.
</para>

<para>
The keybindings described in this section are the defaults as
distributed.  Your local system administrator may have altered the
defaults for your site.  You can always type <quote>?</quote> in any
menu to display the current bindings.
</para>

<para>
The first thing you need to do is invoke Mutt, simply by typing
<literal>mutt</literal> at the command line.  There are various
command-line options, see either the Mutt man page or the <link
linkend="commandline">reference</link>.
</para>

<sect1 id="core-concepts">
<title>Core Concepts</title>

<para>
Mutt is a text-based application which interacts with users through
different menus which are mostly line-/entry-based or page-based. A
line-based menu is the so-called <quote>index</quote> menu (listing all
messages of the currently opened folder) or the <quote>alias</quote>
menu (allowing you to select recipients from a list). Examples for
page-based menus are the <quote>pager</quote> (showing one message at a
time) or the <quote>help</quote> menu listing all available key
bindings.
</para>

<para>
The user interface consists of a context sensitive help line at the top,
the menu's contents followed by a context sensitive status line and
finally the command line. The command line is used to display
informational and error messages as well as for prompts and for entering
interactive commands.
</para>

<para>
Mutt is configured through variables which, if the user wants to
permanently use a non-default value, are written to configuration
files. Mutt supports a rich config file syntax to make even complex
configuration files readable and commentable.
</para>

<para>
Because Mutt allows for customizing almost all key bindings, there are
so-called <quote>functions</quote> which can be executed manually (using
the command line) or in macros. Macros allow the user to bind a sequence
of commands to a single key or a short key sequence instead of repeating
a sequence of actions over and over.
</para>

<para>
Many commands (such as saving or copying a message to another folder)
can be applied to a single message or a set of messages (so-called
<quote>tagged</quote> messages). To help selecting messages, Mutt
provides a rich set of message patterns (such as recipients, sender,
body contents, date sent/received, etc.) which can be combined into
complex expressions using the boolean <emphasis>and</emphasis> and
<emphasis>or</emphasis> operations as well as negating. These patterns
can also be used to (for example) search for messages or to limit the
index to show only matching messages.
</para>

<para>
Mutt supports a <quote>hook</quote> concept which allows the user to
execute arbitrary configuration commands and functions in certain
situations such as entering a folder, starting a new message or replying
to an existing one. These hooks can be used to highly customize Mutt's
behavior including managing multiple identities, customizing the
display for a folder or even implementing auto-archiving based on a
per-folder basis and much more.
</para>

<para>
Besides an interactive mode, Mutt can also be used as a command-line
tool only send messages. It also supports a
<literal>mailx(1)</literal>-compatible interface, see <xref
linkend="tab-commandline-options"/> for a complete list of command-line
options.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="concept-screens-and-menus">
<title>Screens and Menus</title>

<sect2 id="intro-index">
<title>Index</title>

<para>
The index is the screen that you usually see first when you start
Mutt. It gives an overview over your emails in the currently opened
mailbox. By default, this is your system mailbox.  The information you
see in the index is a list of emails, each with its number on the left,
its flags (new email, important email, email that has been forwarded or
replied to, tagged email, ...), the date when email was sent, its
sender, the email size, and the subject. Additionally, the index also
shows thread hierarchies: when you reply to an email, and the other
person replies back, you can see the other person's email in a
"sub-tree" below.  This is especially useful for personal email between
a group of people or when you've subscribed to mailing lists.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-pager">
<title>Pager</title>

<para>
The pager is responsible for showing the email content. On the top of
the pager you have an overview over the most important email headers
like the sender, the recipient, the subject, and much more
information. How much information you actually see depends on your
configuration, which we'll describe below.
</para>

<para>
Below the headers, you see the email body which usually contains the
message. If the email contains any attachments, you will see more
information about them below the email body, or, if the attachments are
text files, you can view them directly in the pager.
</para>

<para>
To give the user a good overview, it is possible to configure Mutt to
show different things in the pager with different colors. Virtually
everything that can be described with a regular expression can be
colored, e.g. URLs, email addresses or smileys.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-browser">
<title>File Browser</title>

<para>
The file browser is the interface to the local or remote file
system. When selecting a mailbox to open, the browser allows custom
sorting of items, limiting the items shown by a regular expression and a
freely adjustable format of what to display in which way. It also allows
for easy navigation through the file system when selecting file(s) to
attach to a message, select multiple files to attach and many more.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-help">
<title>Help</title>

<para>
The help screen is meant to offer a quick help to the user. It lists the
current configuration of key bindings and their associated commands
including a short description, and currently unbound functions that
still need to be associated with a key binding (or alternatively, they
can be called via the Mutt command prompt).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-compose">
<title>Compose Menu</title>

<para>
The compose menu features a split screen containing the information
which really matter before actually sending a message by mail: who gets
the message as what (recipients and who gets what kind of
copy). Additionally, users may set security options like deciding
whether to sign, encrypt or sign and encrypt a message with/for what
keys. Also, it's used to attach messages, to re-edit any attachment
including the message itself.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-alias">
<title>Alias Menu</title>

<para>
The alias menu is used to help users finding the recipients of
messages. For users who need to contact many people, there's no need to
remember addresses or names completely because it allows for searching,
too. The alias mechanism and thus the alias menu also features grouping
several addresses by a shorter nickname, the actual alias, so that users
don't have to select each single recipient manually.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-attach">
<title>Attachment Menu</title>

<para>
As will be later discussed in detail, Mutt features a good and stable
MIME implementation, that is, it supports sending and receiving messages
of arbitrary MIME types. The attachment menu displays a message's
structure in detail: what content parts are attached to which parent
part (which gives a true tree structure), which type is of what type and
what size.  Single parts may saved, deleted or modified to offer great
and easy access to message's internals.
</para>

<para>
Mutt has a built-in line editor for inputting text, e.g. email addresses

<para>
You can remap the <emphasis>editor</emphasis> functions using the <link
linkend="bind"><command>bind</command></link> command.  For example, to
make the &lt;Delete&gt; key delete the character in front of the cursor
rather than under, you could use:
</para>

<screen>
bind editor &lt;delete&gt; backspace
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="editing-history">
<title>History</title>

<para>
Mutt maintains a history for the built-in editor.  The number of items
is controlled by the <link linkend="history">$history</link> variable
and can be made persistent using an external file specified using <link
linkend="history-file">$history_file</link>.  You may cycle through them
at an editor prompt by using the <literal>&lt;history-up&gt;</literal>
and/or <literal>&lt;history-down&gt;</literal> commands. But notice that
Mutt does not remember the currently entered text, it only cycles
through history and wraps around at the end or beginning.
</para>

<para>
Mutt maintains several distinct history lists, one for each of the
following categories:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><literal>.muttrc</literal> commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>addresses and aliases</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>shell commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>filenames</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>patterns</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>everything else</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Mutt automatically filters out consecutively repeated items from the
history. It also mimics the behavior of some shells by ignoring items
starting with a space. The latter feature can be useful in macros to not
clobber the history's valuable entries with unwanted entries.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="reading">
<title>Reading Mail</title>

<para>
Similar to many other mail clients, there are two modes in which mail is
read in Mutt.  The first is a list of messages in the mailbox, which is
called the <quote>index</quote> menu in Mutt.  The second mode is the
display of the message contents.  This is called the
<quote>pager.</quote>

The next few sections describe the functions provided in each of these
modes.

Common keys used to navigate through and manage messages in the index

<title>The Pager</title>

<para>
By default, Mutt uses its built-in pager to display the contents of
messages (an external pager such as <literal>less(1)</literal> can be
configured, see <link linkend="pager">$pager</link> variable).  The
pager is very similar to the Unix program <literal>less(1)</literal>
though not nearly as featureful.

<para>
In addition to key bindings in <xref linkend="tab-key-pager"/>, many of
the functions from the index menu are also available in the pager, such
as <literal>&lt;delete-message&gt;</literal> or
<literal>&lt;copy-message&gt;</literal> (this is one advantage over
using an external pager to view messages).
</para>

<para>
Also, the internal pager supports a couple other advanced features. For
one, it will accept and translate the <quote>standard</quote> nroff
sequences for bold and underline. These sequences are a series of either
the letter, backspace (<quote>^H</quote>), the letter again for bold or
the letter, backspace, <quote>_</quote> for denoting underline. Mutt
will attempt to display these in bold and underline respectively if your
terminal supports them. If not, you can use the bold and underline <link
linkend="color">color</link> objects to specify a
<command>color</command> or mono attribute for them.
</para>

<para>
Additionally, the internal pager supports the ANSI escape sequences for
character attributes.  Mutt translates them into the correct color and
character settings.  The sequences Mutt supports are:
</para>

<screen>
\e[<emphasis>Ps</emphasis>;<emphasis>Ps</emphasis>;..<emphasis>Ps</emphasis>;m
</screen>

<para>
where <emphasis>Ps</emphasis> can be one of the codes shown in <xref

<note>
<para>
If you change the colors for your display, for example by changing the
color associated with color2 for your xterm, then that color will be
used instead of green.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
Note that the search commands in the pager take regular expressions,
which are not quite the same as the more complex <link
linkend="patterns">patterns</link> used by the search command in the
index. This is because patterns are used to select messages by criteria
whereas the pager already displays a selected message.

<sect2 id="threads">
<title>Threaded Mode</title>

<para>
So-called <quote>threads</quote> provide a hierarchy of messages where
replies are linked to their parent message(s). This organizational form
is extremely useful in mailing lists where different parts of the
discussion diverge. Mutt displays threads as a tree structure.
</para>

<para>
In Mutt, when a mailbox is <link linkend="sort">sorted</link>

<para>
Collapsing a thread displays only the first message in the thread and
hides the others. This is useful when threads contain so many messages
that you can only see a handful of threads on the screen. See %M in
<link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>.  For example, you
could use <quote>%?M?(#%03M)&amp;(%4l)?</quote> in <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> to optionally display the
number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed. The
<literal>%?&lt;char&gt;?&lt;if-part&gt;&amp;&lt;else-part&gt;?</literal>
syntax is explained in detail in <link
linkend="formatstrings-conditionals">format string conditionals</link>.
</para>

<para>
Technically, every reply should contain a list of its parent messages in
the thread tree, but not all do. In these cases, Mutt groups them by
subject which can be controlled using the <link
linkend="strict-threads">$strict_threads</link> variable.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="reading-misc">
<title>Miscellaneous Functions</title>

<para>
In addition, the <emphasis>index</emphasis> and

</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;create-alias&gt;</literal><anchor id="create-alias"/>
(default: a)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Creates a new alias based upon the current message (or prompts for a new
one).  Once editing is complete, an <link
linkend="alias"><command>alias</command></link> command is added to the
file specified by the <link linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link>
variable for future use
</para>

<note>
<para>
Mutt does not read the <link linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;check-traditional-pgp&gt;</literal><anchor
id="check-traditional-pgp"/> (default: Esc P)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This function will search the current message for content signed or
encrypted with PGP the <quote>traditional</quote> way, that is, without
proper MIME tagging.  Technically, this function will temporarily change
the MIME content types of the body parts containing PGP data; this is
similar to the <link
linkend="edit-type"><literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal></link>
function's effect.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;edit&gt;</literal><anchor id="edit"/> (default: e)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command (available in the index and pager) allows you to edit the
raw current message as it's present in the mail folder.  After you have
finished editing, the changed message will be appended to the current
folder, and the original message will be marked for deletion; if the
message is unchanged it won't be replaced.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal><anchor id="edit-type"/> (default:
^E on the attachment menu, and in the pager and index menus; ^T on the
compose menu)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command is used to temporarily edit an attachment's content type to
fix, for instance, bogus character set parameters.  When invoked from
the index or from the pager, you'll have the opportunity to edit the
top-level attachment's content type.  On the <link
linkend="attach-menu">attachment menu</link>, you can change any
attachment's content type. These changes are not persistent, and get
lost upon changing folders.
</para>

<para>
Note that this command is also available on the <link
linkend="compose-menu">compose menu</link>.  There, it's used to
fine-tune the properties of attachments you are going to send.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;enter-command&gt;</literal><anchor id="enter-command"/>
(default: <quote>:</quote>)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command is used to execute any command you would normally put in a
configuration file.  A common use is to check the settings of variables,
or in conjunction with <link linkend="macro">macros</link> to change
settings on the fly.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;extract-keys&gt;</literal><anchor id="extract-keys"/>
(default: ^K)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command extracts PGP public keys from the current or tagged
message(s) and adds them to your PGP public key ring.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;forget-passphrase&gt;</literal><anchor
id="forget-passphrase"/> (default: ^F)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command wipes the passphrase(s) from memory. It is useful, if you
misspelled the passphrase.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal><anchor id="list-reply"/> (default:
L)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Reply to the current or tagged message(s) by extracting any addresses
which match the regular expressions given by the <link
linkend="lists"><command>lists</command> or
<command>subscribe</command></link> commands, but also honor any
<literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header(s) if the <link
linkend="honor-followup-to">$honor_followup_to</link> configuration
variable is set.  Using this when replying to messages posted to mailing
lists helps avoid duplicate copies being sent to the author of the
message you are replying to.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;pipe-message&gt;</literal><anchor id="pipe-message"/>
(default: |)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Asks for an external Unix command and pipes the current or tagged
message(s) to it.  The variables <link
linkend="pipe-decode">$pipe_decode</link>, <link
linkend="pipe-split">$pipe_split</link>, <link
linkend="pipe-sep">$pipe_sep</link> and <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> control the exact behavior of this
function.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;resend-message&gt;</literal><anchor id="resend-message"/>
(default: Esc e)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt takes the current message as a template for a new message.  This
function is best described as "recall from arbitrary folders".  It can
conveniently be used to forward MIME messages while preserving the
original mail structure. Note that the amount of headers included here
depends on the value of the <link linkend="weed">$weed</link> variable.
</para>

<para>
This function is also available from the attachment menu. You can use
this to easily resend a message which was included with a bounce message
as a <literal>message/rfc822</literal> body part.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;shell-escape&gt;</literal><anchor id="shell-escape"/>
(default: !)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Asks for an external Unix command and executes it.  The <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> can be used to control whether Mutt
will wait for a key to be pressed when the command returns (presumably
to let the user read the output of the command), based on the return
status of the named command. If no command is given, an interactive
shell is executed.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;toggle-quoted&gt;</literal><anchor id="toggle-quoted"/>
(default: T)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
The pager uses the <link linkend="quote-regexp">$quote_regexp</link>
variable to detect quoted text when displaying the body of the message.
This function toggles the display of the quoted material in the message.
It is particularly useful when being interested in just the response and
there is a large amount of quoted text in the way.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;skip-quoted&gt;</literal><anchor id="skip-quoted"/>

When replying to messages, the <emphasis>In-Reply-To:</emphasis> header

<sect2 id="sending-crypto">
<title>Sending Cryptographically Signed/Encrypted Messages</title>

<para>
If you have told Mutt to PGP or S/MIME encrypt a message, it will guide
you through a key selection process when you try to send the message.
Mutt will not ask you any questions about keys which have a certified
user ID matching one of the message recipients' mail addresses.
However, there may be situations in which there are several keys, weakly
certified user ID fields, or where no matching keys can be found.
</para>

<para>
In these cases, you are dropped into a menu with a list of keys from
which you can select one.  When you quit this menu, or Mutt can't find
any matching keys, you are prompted for a user ID.  You can, as usually,
abort this prompt using <literal>^G</literal>.  When you do so, Mutt
will return to the compose screen.
</para>

<para>
Once you have successfully finished the key selection, the message will
be encrypted using the selected public keys when sent out.
</para>

<para>
Most fields of the entries in the key selection menu (see also <link
linkend="pgp-entry-format">$pgp_entry_format</link>) have obvious
meanings.  But some explanations on the capabilities, flags, and
validity fields are in order.
</para>

<para>
The flags sequence (<quote>%f</quote>) will expand to one of the flags
in <xref linkend="tab-pgp-menuflags"/>.

</tgroup>
</table>

<para>
The capabilities field (<quote>%c</quote>) expands to a two-character
sequence representing a key's capabilities.  The first character gives
the key's encryption capabilities: A minus sign (<quote>-</quote>) means
that the key cannot be used for encryption.  A dot (<quote>.</quote>)
means that it's marked as a signature key in one of the user IDs, but
may also be used for encryption.  The letter <quote>e</quote> indicates
that this key can be used for encryption.
</para>

<para>
The second character indicates the key's signing capabilities.  Once
again, a <quote>-</quote> implies <quote>not for signing</quote>,
<quote>.</quote> implies that the key is marked as an encryption key in
one of the user-ids, and <quote>s</quote> denotes a key which can be
used for signing.
</para>

<para>
Finally, the validity field (<quote>%t</quote>) indicates how
well-certified a user-id is.  A question mark (<quote>?</quote>)
indicates undefined validity, a minus character (<quote>-</quote>) marks
an untrusted association, a space character means a partially trusted
association, and a plus character (<quote>+</quote>) indicates complete
validity.

<para>
<literal>format=flowed</literal>-style messages (or
<literal>f=f</literal> for short) are <literal>text/plain</literal>
messages that consist of paragraphs which a receiver's mail client may
reformat to its own needs which mostly means to customize line lengths
regardless of what the sender sent. Technically this is achieved by
letting lines of a <quote>flowable</quote> paragraph end in spaces
except for the last line.
</para>

<para>
While for text-mode clients like Mutt it's the best way to assume only a
standard 80x25 character cell terminal, it may be desired to let the
receiver decide completely how to view a message.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="ff-support">

<para>
Mutt only supports setting the required <literal>format=flowed</literal>

it does not add the trailing spaces.
</para>

<para>
After editing the initial message text and before entering the compose

<note>
<para>
Mutt only supports space-stuffing for the first two types of lines but
not for the third: It is impossible to safely detect whether a leading
<literal>&gt;</literal> character starts a quote or not. Furthermore,
Mutt only applies space-stuffing <emphasis>once</emphasis> after the
initial edit is finished.

As Mutt provides no additional features to compose

<sect1 id="forwarding-mail">
<title>Forwarding and Bouncing Mail</title>

<para>
Bouncing and forwarding let you send an existing message to recipients
that you specify. Bouncing a message sends a verbatim copy of a message
to alternative addresses as if they were the message's original
recipients specified in the Bcc header.  Forwarding a message, on the
other hand, allows you to modify the message before it is resent (for
example, by adding your own comments). Bouncing is done using the
<literal>&lt;bounce&gt;</literal> function and forwarding using the
<literal>&lt;forward&gt;</literal> function bound to <quote>b</quote>
and <quote>f</quote> respectively.
</para>

<para>
Forwarding can be done by including the original message in the new
message's body (surrounded by indicating lines) or including it as a
MIME attachment, depending on the value of the <link
linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> variable.  Decoding of
attachments, like in the pager, can be controlled by the <link
linkend="forward-decode">$forward_decode</link> and <link
linkend="mime-forward-decode">$mime_forward_decode</link> variables,
respectively.  The desired forwarding format may depend on the content,
therefore <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is a
quadoption which, for example, can be set to <quote>ask-no</quote>.
</para>

<para>
The inclusion of headers is controlled by the current setting of the
<link linkend="weed">$weed</link> variable, unless <link
linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is set.
</para>

<para>
Editing the message to forward follows the same procedure as sending or
replying to a message does.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="postponing-mail">
<title>Postponing Mail</title>

<para>
At times it is desirable to delay sending a message that you have
already begun to compose.  When the
<literal>&lt;postpone-message&gt;</literal> function is used in the
<emphasis>compose</emphasis> menu, the body of your message and
attachments are stored in the mailbox specified by the <link
linkend="postponed">$postponed</link> variable.  This means that you can
recall the message even if you exit Mutt and then restart it at a later
time.
</para>

<para>
Once a message is postponed, there are several ways to resume it.  From
the command line you can use the <quote>-p</quote> option, or if you
compose a new message from the <emphasis>index</emphasis> or
<emphasis>pager</emphasis> you will be prompted if postponed messages
exist.  If multiple messages are currently postponed, the
<emphasis>postponed</emphasis> menu will pop up and you can select which
message you would like to resume.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you postpone a reply to a message, the reply setting of the message
is only updated when you actually finish the message and send it.  Also,
you must be in the same folder with the message you replied to for the
status of the message to be updated.

<chapter id="configuration">
<title>Configuration</title>

<sect1 id="configuration-files">
<title>Location of Initialization Files</title>

<para>
While the default configuration (or <quote>preferences</quote>) make
Mutt usable right out of the box, it is often desirable to tailor Mutt
to suit your own tastes. When Mutt is first invoked, it will attempt to
read the <quote>system</quote> configuration file (defaults set by your
local system administrator), unless the <quote>-n</quote> <link
linkend="commandline">command line</link> option is specified.  This
file is typically <literal>/usr/local/share/mutt/Muttrc</literal> or
<literal>/etc/Muttrc</literal>. Mutt will next look for a file named
<literal>.muttrc</literal> in your home directory.  If this file does
not exist and your home directory has a subdirectory named
<literal>.mutt</literal>, Mutt tries to load a file named
<literal>.mutt/muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
<literal>.muttrc</literal> is the file where you will usually place your
<link linkend="commands">commands</link> to configure Mutt.
</para>

<para>
In addition, Mutt supports version specific configuration files that are
parsed instead of the default files as explained above.  For instance,
if your system has a <literal>Muttrc-0.88</literal> file in the system
configuration directory, and you are running version 0.88 of Mutt, this
file will be sourced instead of the <literal>Muttrc</literal> file.  The
same is true of the user configuration file, if you have a file
<literal>.muttrc-0.88.6</literal> in your home directory, when you run
Mutt version 0.88.6, it will source this file instead of the default
<literal>.muttrc</literal> file.  The version number is the same which
is visible using the <quote>-v</quote> <link
linkend="commandline">command line</link> switch or using the
<literal>show-version</literal> key (default: V) from the index menu.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="muttrc-syntax" xreflabel="Syntax of Initialization Files">
<title>Syntax of Initialization Files</title>

<para>
An initialization file consists of a series of <link
linkend="commands">commands</link>.  Each line of the file may contain
one or more commands.  When multiple commands are used, they must be
separated by a semicolon (<quote>;</quote>).
</para>

<example id="ex-rc-multiple-cmds">
<title>Multiple configuration commands per line</title>
<screen>
set realname='Mutt user' ; ignore x-
</screen>
</example>

<para>
The hash mark, or pound sign (<quote>#</quote>), is used as a
<quote>comment</quote> character. You can use it to annotate your
initialization file. All text after the comment character to the end of
the line is ignored.
</para>

<example id="ex-ec-comment">
<title>Commenting configuration files</title>
<screen>
my_hdr X-Disclaimer: Why are you listening to me? <emphasis role="comment"># This is a comment</emphasis>
</screen>
</example>

<para>
Single quotes (<quote>'</quote>) and double quotes (<quote>"</quote>)
can be used to quote strings which contain spaces or other special
characters.  The difference between the two types of quotes is similar
to that of many popular shell programs, namely that a single quote is
used to specify a literal string (one that is not interpreted for shell
variables or quoting with a backslash [see next paragraph]), while
double quotes indicate a string for which should be evaluated.  For
example, backticks are evaluated inside of double quotes, but
<emphasis>not</emphasis> for single quotes.
</para>

<para>
<quote>\</quote> quotes the next character, just as in shells such as
bash and zsh.  For example, if want to put quotes <quote>"</quote>
inside of a string, you can use <quote>\</quote> to force the next
character to be a literal instead of interpreted character.
</para>

<example id="ex-rc-quote">
<title>Escaping quotes in configuration files</title>

<quote>\n</quote> and <quote>\r</quote> have their usual C meanings of linefeed and
carriage-return, respectively.
</para>

<para>
A <quote>\</quote> at the end of a line can be used to split commands
over multiple lines as it <quote>escapes</quote> the line end, provided
that the split points don't appear in the middle of command names. Lines
are first concatenated before interpretation so that a multi-line can be
commented by commenting out the first line only.

<para>
It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
initialization file.  This is accomplished by enclosing the command in
backticks (``). In <xref linkend="ex-rc-backtick"/>, the output of the
Unix command <quote>uname -a</quote> will be substituted before the line
is parsed.  Since initialization files are line oriented, only the first
line of output from the Unix command will be substituted.

<para>
Both environment variables and Mutt variables can be accessed by
prepending <quote>$</quote> to the name of the variable. For example,
</para>

<example id="ex-rc-env">
<title>Using environment variables in configuration files</title>
<screen>
set record=+sent_on_$HOSTNAME
</screen>
</example>

<para>
will cause Mutt to save outgoing messages to a folder named
<quote>sent_on_kremvax</quote> if the environment variable
<literal>$HOSTNAME</literal> is set to <quote>kremvax.</quote> (See
<link linkend="record">$record</link> for details.)
</para>

<para>
Mutt expands the variable when it is assigned, not when it is used. If
the value of a variable on the right-hand side of an assignment changes
after the assignment, the variable on the left-hand side will not be
affected.
</para>

<para>
The commands understood by Mutt are explained in the next paragraphs.
For a complete list, see the <link linkend="commands">command
reference</link>.
</para>

<para>
All configuration files are expected to be in the current locale as
specified by the <link linkend="charset">$charset</link> variable which
doesn't have a default value since it's determined by Mutt at startup.
If a configuration file is not encoded in the same character set the
<link linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> variable should be
used: all lines starting with the next are recoded from <link
linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> to <link
linkend="charset">$charset</link>.
</para>

<para>
This mechanism should be avoided if possible as it has the following
implications:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>These variables should be set early in a configuration

<para>
Mutt supports grouping addresses logically into named groups. An address
or address pattern can appear in several groups at the same time. These
groups can be used in <link linkend="patterns">patterns</link> (for searching, limiting and tagging) and
in hooks by using group patterns. This can be useful to classify mail
and take certain actions depending on in what groups the message is.
For example, the mutt user's mailing list would fit into the categories
<quote>mailing list</quote> and <quote>mutt-related</quote>. Using <link
linkend="send-hook"><literal>send-hook</literal></link>, the sender can
be set to a dedicated one for writing mailing list messages, and the
signature could be set to a mutt-related one for writing to a mutt list
&mdash; for other lists, the list sender setting still applies but a
different signature can be selected. Or, given a group only containing
recipients known to accept encrypted mail,
<quote>auto-encryption</quote> can be achieved easily.
</para>

<para>
The <command>group</command> command is used to directly add either
addresses or regular expressions to the specified group or groups. The
different categories of arguments to the <command>group</command>
command can be in any order. The flags <literal>-rx</literal> and
<literal>-addr</literal> specify what the following strings (that cannot
begin with a hyphen) should be interpreted as: either a regular
expression or an email address, respectively.
</para>

<para>
These address groups can also be created implicitly by the <link
linkend="alias"><command>alias</command></link>, <link
linkend="lists"><command>lists</command></link>, <link
linkend="lists"><command>subscribe</command></link> and <link
linkend="alternates"><command>alternates</command></link> commands by
specifying the optional <literal>-group</literal> option. For example,
</para>

<screen>
alternates -group me address1 address2
alternates -group me -group work address3
</screen>

<para>
would create a group named <quote>me</quote> which contains all your
addresses and a group named <quote>work</quote> which contains only your
work address <emphasis>address3</emphasis>. Besides many other
possibilities, this could be used to automatically mark your own
messages in a mailing list folder as read or use a special signature for
work-related messages.
</para>

<para>
The <command>ungroup</command> command is used to remove addresses or
regular expressions from the specified group or groups. The syntax is
similar to the <command>group</command> command, however the special
character <literal>*</literal> can be used to empty a group of all of
its contents. As soon as a group gets empty because all addresses and
regular expressions have been removed, it'll internally be removed, too
(i.e. there cannot be an empty group). When removing regular expressions
from a group, the pattern must be specified exactly as given to the
<command>group</command> command or <literal>-group</literal> argument.

<note>
<para>
If you want to create an alias for more than one address, you
<emphasis>must</emphasis> separate the addresses with a comma
(<quote>,</quote>).
</para>
</note>

<para>
The optional <literal>-group</literal> argument to
<command>alias</command> causes the aliased address(es) to be added to

<para>
To remove an alias or aliases (<quote>*</quote> means all aliases):
</para>

<screen>
alias muttdude me@cs.hmc.edu (Michael Elkins)
alias theguys manny, moe, jack
</screen>

<para>
Unlike other mailers, Mutt doesn't require aliases to be defined in a
special file.  The <command>alias</command> command can appear anywhere
in a configuration file, as long as this file is <link
linkend="source"><command>source</command>d</link>.  Consequently, you
can have multiple alias files, or you can have all aliases defined in
your <literal>.muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
On the other hand, the <link
linkend="create-alias"><literal>&lt;create-alias&gt;</literal></link>
function can use only one file, the one pointed to by the <link
linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link> variable (which is
<literal>~/.muttrc</literal> by default). This file is not special
either, in the sense that Mutt will happily append aliases to any file,
but in order for the new aliases to take effect you need to explicitly
<link linkend="source"><command>source</command></link> this file too.
</para>

<example id="ex-alias-external">
<title>Configuring external alias files</title>
<screen>
source /usr/local/share/Mutt.aliases

<para>
To use aliases, you merely use the alias at any place in Mutt where Mutt
prompts for addresses, such as the <emphasis>To:</emphasis> or
<emphasis>Cc:</emphasis> prompt.  You can also enter aliases in your
editor at the appropriate headers if you have the <link
linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link> variable set.
</para>

<para>
In addition, at the various address prompts, you can use the tab
character to expand a partial alias to the full alias.  If there are
multiple matches, Mutt will bring up a menu with the matching aliases.
In order to be presented with the full list of aliases, you must hit tab
without a partial alias, such as at the beginning of the prompt or after
a comma denoting multiple addresses.
</para>

<para>
In the alias menu, you can select as many aliases as you want with the
<literal>select-entry</literal> key (default: &lt;Return&gt;), and use
the <emphasis>exit</emphasis> key (default: q) to return to the address
prompt.

<emphasis>key</emphasis> is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind.
To specify a control character, use the sequence
<emphasis>\Cx</emphasis>, where <emphasis>x</emphasis> is the letter of
the control character (for example, to specify control-A use
<quote>\Ca</quote>).  Note that the case of <emphasis>x</emphasis> as
well as <emphasis>\C</emphasis> is ignored, so that
<emphasis>\CA</emphasis>, <emphasis>\Ca</emphasis>,
<emphasis>\cA</emphasis> and <emphasis>\ca</emphasis> are all
equivalent.  An alternative form is to specify the key as a three digit
octal number prefixed with a <quote>\</quote> (for example
<emphasis>\177</emphasis> is equivalent to <emphasis>\c?</emphasis>). In
addition, <emphasis>key</emphasis> may be a symbolic name as shown in

<para>
It is often desirable to change settings based on which mailbox you are
reading.  The <command>folder-hook</command> command provides a method
by which you can execute any configuration command.
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> is a regular expression specifying in which
mailboxes to execute <emphasis>command</emphasis> before loading.  If a
mailbox matches multiple <command>folder-hook</command>s, they are
executed in the order given in the <literal>.muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you use the <quote>!</quote> shortcut for <link
linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link> at the beginning of the pattern,
you must place it inside of double or single quotes in order to
distinguish it from the logical <emphasis>not</emphasis> operator for
the expression.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
Settings are <emphasis>not</emphasis> restored when you leave the
mailbox.  For example, a command action to perform is to change the
sorting method based upon the mailbox being read:
</para>

<screen>
folder-hook mutt "set sort=threads"</screen>

<para>
However, the sorting method is not restored to its previous value when
reading a different mailbox.  To specify a <emphasis>default</emphasis>
command, use the pattern <quote>.</quote> before other
<command>folder-hook</command>s adjusting a value on a per-folder basis
because <command>folder-hook</command>s are evaluated in the order given
in the configuration file.
</para>
</note>

<para>
The following example will set the <link linkend="sort">sort</link>

</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
Macros are useful when you would like a single key to perform a series
of actions.  When you press <emphasis>key</emphasis> in menu
<emphasis>menu</emphasis>, Mutt will behave as if you had typed
<emphasis>sequence</emphasis>.  So if you have a common sequence of
commands you type, you can create a macro to execute those commands with
a single key or fewer keys.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>menu</emphasis> is the <link linkend="maps">map</link> which
the macro will be bound in.  Multiple maps may be specified by
separating multiple menu arguments by commas. Whitespace may not be used
in between the menu arguments and the commas separating them.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>key</emphasis> and <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> are expanded
by the same rules as the <link linkend="bind">key bindings</link> with
some additions.  The first is that control characters in
<emphasis>sequence</emphasis> can also be specified as
<emphasis>^x</emphasis>.  In order to get a caret (<quote>^</quote>) you
need to use <emphasis>^^</emphasis>.  Secondly, to specify a certain key
such as <emphasis>up</emphasis> or to invoke a function directly, you
can use the format <emphasis>&lt;key name&gt;</emphasis> and
<emphasis>&lt;function name&gt;</emphasis>.  For a listing of key names
see the section on <link linkend="bind">key bindings</link>.  Functions
are listed in the <link linkend="functions">reference</link>.
</para>

<para>
The advantage with using function names directly is that the macros will
work regardless of the current key bindings, so they are not dependent
on the user having particular key definitions.  This makes them more
robust and portable, and also facilitates defining of macros in files
used by more than one user (e.g., the system Muttrc).
</para>

<para>
Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after
<emphasis>sequence</emphasis>, which is shown in the help screens if
they contain a description.

<para>
If your terminal supports color, you can spice up Mutt by creating your
own color scheme.  To define the color of an object (type of
information), you must specify both a foreground color
<emphasis>and</emphasis> a background color (it is not possible to only
specify one or the other).
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>header</emphasis> and <emphasis>body</emphasis> match
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> in the header/body of a message,
<emphasis>index</emphasis> matches <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> (see

<para>
<emphasis>foreground</emphasis> can optionally be prefixed with the
keyword <literal>bright</literal> to make the foreground color boldfaced
(e.g., <literal>brightred</literal>).
</para>

<para>
If your terminal supports it, the special keyword
<emphasis>default</emphasis> can be used as a transparent color.  The
value <emphasis>brightdefault</emphasis> is also valid.  If Mutt is
linked against the <emphasis>S-Lang</emphasis> library, you also need to
set the <literal>$COLORFGBG</literal> environment variable to the
default colors of your terminal for this to work; for example (for
Bourne-like shells):
</para>

<screen>
set COLORFGBG="green;black"
export COLORFGBG
</screen>

<note>
<para>
The <emphasis>S-Lang</emphasis> library requires you to use the
<emphasis>lightgray</emphasis> and <emphasis>brown</emphasis> keywords
instead of <emphasis>white</emphasis> and <emphasis>yellow</emphasis>
when setting this variable.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The <command>uncolor</command> command can be applied to the index,
header and body objects only.  It removes entries from the list. You
<emphasis>must</emphasis> specify the same pattern specified in the
<command>color</command> command for it to be removed.  The pattern
<quote>*</quote> is a special token which means to clear the color list
of all entries.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Mutt also recognizes the keywords <emphasis>color0</emphasis>,
<emphasis>color1</emphasis>, ...,
<emphasis>color</emphasis><emphasis>N-1</emphasis>
(<emphasis>N</emphasis> being the number of colors supported by your
terminal).  This is useful when you remap the colors for your display
(for example by changing the color associated with
<emphasis>color2</emphasis> for your xterm), since color names may then
lose their normal meaning.

Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing

<para>
You do not need to specify the full header field name.  For example,
<quote>ignore content-</quote> will ignore all header fields that begin

ignore all headers.
</para>

<para>
To remove a previously added token from the list, use the
<quote>unignore</quote> command.  The <quote>unignore</quote> command
will make Mutt display headers with the given pattern.  For example, if
you do <quote>ignore x-</quote> it is possible to <quote>unignore
x-mailer</quote>.
</para>

<quote>unignore *</quote> will remove all tokens from the ignore list.

</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
With various functions, Mutt will treat messages differently, depending
on whether you sent them or whether you received them from someone else.
For instance, when replying to a message that you sent to a different
party, Mutt will automatically suggest to send the response to the
original message's recipients &mdash; responding to yourself won't make
much sense in many cases.  (See <link
linkend="reply-to">$reply_to</link>.)
</para>

<para>
Many users receive e-mail under a number of different addresses. To
fully use Mutt's features here, the program must be able to recognize
what e-mail addresses you receive mail under. That's the purpose of the
<command>alternates</command> command: It takes a list of regular
expressions, each of which can identify an address under which you
receive e-mail.
</para>

<para>
As addresses are matched using regular expressions and not exact strict
comparisons, you should make sure you specify your addresses as precise
as possible to avoid mismatches. For example, if you specify:
</para>

<screen>
alternates user@example
</screen>

<para>
Mutt will consider <quote><literal>some-user@example</literal></quote>
as being your address, too which may not be desired. As a solution, in
such cases addresses should be specified as:
</para>

<screen>
alternates '^user@example$'
</screen>

<para>
The <literal>-group</literal> flag causes all of the subsequent regular
expressions to be added to the named group.
</para>

<para>
The <command>unalternates</command> command can be used to write
exceptions to <command>alternates</command> patterns. If an address
matches something in an <command>alternates</command> command, but you
nonetheless do not think it is from you, you can list a more precise
pattern under an <command>unalternates</command> command.
</para>

<para>
To remove a regular expression from the <command>alternates</command>
list, use the <command>unalternates</command> command with exactly the
same <emphasis>regexp</emphasis>.  Likewise, if the
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> for an <command>alternates</command> command
matches an entry on the <command>unalternates</command> list, that
<command>unalternates</command> entry will be removed. If the
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> for <command>unalternates</command> is
<quote>*</quote>, <emphasis>all entries</emphasis> on
<command>alternates</command> will be removed.

<para>
Mutt has a few nice features for <link linkend="using-lists">handling
mailing lists</link>.  In order to take advantage of them, you must
specify which addresses belong to mailing lists, and which mailing lists
you are subscribed to. Mutt also has limited support for auto-detecting
mailing lists: it supports parsing <literal>mailto:</literal> links in
the common <literal>List-Post:</literal> header which has the same
effect as specifying the list address via the <command>lists</command>
command (except the group feature). Once you have done this, the <link
linkend="list-reply"><literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal></link>
function will work for all known lists.  Additionally, when you send a
message to a subscribed list, Mutt will add a Mail-Followup-To header to
tell other users' mail user agents not to send copies of replies to your
personal address.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not
supported by all mail user agents.  Adding it is not bullet-proof
against receiving personal CCs of list messages.  Also note that the
generation of the Mail-Followup-To header is controlled by the <link
linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link> configuration variable since
it's common practice on some mailing lists to send Cc upon replies
(which is more a group- than a list-reply).
</para>
</note>

<para>
More precisely, Mutt maintains lists of patterns for the addresses of
known and subscribed mailing lists.  Every subscribed mailing list is
known. To mark a mailing list as known, use the <command>list</command>
command.  To mark it as subscribed, use <command>subscribe</command>.
</para>

<para>
You can use regular expressions with both commands. To mark all messages
sent to a specific bug report's address on Debian's bug tracking system
as list mail, for instance, you could say
</para>

<screen>
subscribe [0-9]*.*@bugs.debian.org</screen>

<para>
as it's often sufficient to just give a portion of the list's e-mail
address.
</para>

<para>
Specify as much of the address as you need to to remove ambiguity.  For
example, if you've subscribed to the Mutt mailing list, you will receive
mail addressed to <literal>mutt-users@mutt.org</literal>.  So, to tell
Mutt that this is a mailing list, you could add <literal>lists
mutt-users@</literal> to your initialization file.  To tell Mutt that
you are subscribed to it, add <literal><command>subscribe</command>
mutt-users</literal> to your initialization file instead.  If you also
happen to get mail from someone whose address is
<literal>mutt-users@example.com</literal>, you could use
<literal><command>lists</command> ^mutt-users@mutt\\.org$</literal> or
<literal><command>subscribe</command> ^mutt-users@mutt\\.org$</literal>
to match only mail from the actual list.
</para>

<para>
The <literal>-group</literal> flag adds all of the subsequent regular
expressions to the named <link linkend="addrgroup">address group</link>
in addition to adding to the specified address list.
</para>

<para>
The <quote>unlists</quote> command is used to remove a token from the
list of known and subscribed mailing-lists. Use <quote>unlists *</quote>
to remove all tokens.
</para>

<para>
To remove a mailing list from the list of subscribed mailing lists, but
keep it on the list of known mailing lists, use
<command>unsubscribe</command>.

<para>
<emphasis>folder</emphasis> can either be a local file or directory
(Mbox/Mmdf or Maildir/Mh). If Mutt was built with POP and/or IMAP
support, <emphasis>folder</emphasis> can also be a POP/IMAP folder
URL. The URL syntax is described in <xref linkend="url-syntax"/>, POP
and IMAP are described in <xref linkend="pop"/> and <xref

<para>
The folders in the <command>mailboxes</command> command are resolved
when the command is executed, so if these names contain <link

used, a local path should be absolute as otherwise Mutt tries to find it
relative to the directory from where Mutt was started which may not
always be desired.

</example>

<para>
For using functions like shown in the example, it's important to use
angle brackets (<quote>&lt;</quote> and <quote>&gt;</quote>) to make
Mutt recognize the input as a function name. Otherwise it will simulate
individual just keystrokes, i.e. <quote><literal>push
collapse-all</literal></quote> would be interpreted as if you had typed
<quote>c</quote>, followed by <quote>o</quote>, followed by
<quote>l</quote>, ..., which is not desired and may lead to very
unexpected behavior.
</para>

<para>
Keystrokes can be used, too, but are less portable because of
potentially changed key bindings. With default bindings, this is
equivalent to the above example:
</para>

<screen>
folder-hook . 'push \eV'

because it simulates that Esc+V was pressed (which is the default

</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
Mutt has generalized support for external spam-scoring filters.  By
defining your spam patterns with the <command>spam</command> and
<literal>nospam</literal> commands, you can <emphasis>limit</emphasis>,
<emphasis>search</emphasis>, and <emphasis>sort</emphasis> your mail
based on its spam attributes, as determined by the external filter. You
also can display the spam attributes in your index display using the
<literal>%H</literal> selector in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. (Tip: try
<literal>%?H?[%H] ?</literal> to display spam tags only when they are
defined for a given message.)
</para>

<para>
Your first step is to define your external filter's spam patterns using
the <command>spam</command> command. <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> should
be a regular expression that matches a header in a mail message. If any
message in the mailbox matches this regular expression, it will receive
a <quote>spam tag</quote> or <quote>spam attribute</quote> (unless it
also matches a <command>nospam</command> pattern &mdash; see below.) The
appearance of this attribute is entirely up to you, and is governed by
the <emphasis>format</emphasis> parameter. <emphasis>format</emphasis>
can be any static text, but it also can include back-references from the
<emphasis>pattern</emphasis> expression. (A regular expression
<quote>back-reference</quote> refers to a sub-expression contained
within parentheses.) <literal>%1</literal> is replaced with the first
back-reference in the regex, <literal>%2</literal> with the second, etc.
</para>

<para>
To match spam tags, mutt needs the corresponding header information
which is always the case for local and POP folders but not for IMAP in
the default configuration. Depending on the spam header to be analyzed,
<link linkend="imap-headers">$imap_headers</link> may need to be
adjusted.
</para>

<para>
If you're using multiple spam filters, a message can have more than one
spam-related header. You can define <command>spam</command> patterns for
each filter you use. If a message matches two or more of these patterns,
and the <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> variable
is set to a string, then the message's spam tag will consist of all the
<emphasis>format</emphasis> strings joined together, with the value of
<link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> separating them.
</para>

<para>
For example, suppose one uses DCC, SpamAssassin, and PureMessage, then
the configuration might look like in <xref linkend="ex-spam"/>.
</para>

<example id="ex-spam">
<title>Configuring spam detection</title>
<screen>
spam "X-DCC-.*-Metrics:.*(....)=many"         "90+/DCC-%1"
spam "X-Spam-Status: Yes"                     "90+/SA"
spam "X-PerlMX-Spam: .*Probability=([0-9]+)%" "%1/PM"
set spam_separator=", "
</screen>
</example>

<para>
If then a message is received that DCC registered with
<quote>many</quote> hits under the <quote>Fuz2</quote> checksum, and
that PureMessage registered with a 97% probability of being spam, that
message's spam tag would read <literal>90+/DCC-Fuz2,
97/PM</literal>. (The four characters before <quote>=many</quote> in a
DCC report indicate the checksum used &mdash; in this case,
<quote>Fuz2</quote>.)
</para>

<para>
If the <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> variable is
unset, then each spam pattern match supersedes the previous one. Instead
of getting joined <emphasis>format</emphasis> strings, you'll get only
the last one to match.
</para>

<para>
The spam tag is what will be displayed in the index when you use
<literal>%H</literal> in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. It's also the
string that the <literal>~H</literal> pattern-matching expression
matches against for <literal>&lt;search&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;limit&gt;</literal> functions. And it's what sorting by
spam attribute will use as a sort key.
</para>

<para>
That's a pretty complicated example, and most people's actual
environments will have only one spam filter. The simpler your
configuration, the more effective Mutt can be, especially when it comes
to sorting.
</para>

<para>
Generally, when you sort by spam tag, Mutt will sort
<emphasis>lexically</emphasis> &mdash; that is, by ordering strings
alphanumerically. However, if a spam tag begins with a number, Mutt will
sort numerically first, and lexically only when two numbers are equal in
value. (This is like UNIX's <literal>sort -n</literal>.) A message with
no spam attributes at all &mdash; that is, one that didn't match
<emphasis>any</emphasis> of your <command>spam</command> patterns
&mdash; is sorted at lowest priority. Numbers are sorted next, beginning
with 0 and ranging upward. Finally, non-numeric strings are sorted, with
<quote>a</quote> taking lower priority than <quote>z</quote>. Clearly,
in general, sorting by spam tags is most effective when you can coerce
your filter to give you a raw number. But in case you can't, Mutt can
still do something useful.
</para>

<para>
The <command>nospam</command> command can be used to write exceptions to
<command>spam</command> patterns. If a header pattern matches something
in a <command>spam</command> command, but you nonetheless do not want it
to receive a spam tag, you can list a more precise pattern under a
<command>nospam</command> command.
</para>

<para>
If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> given to <command>nospam</command>
is exactly the same as the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> on an existing
<command>spam</command> list entry, the effect will be to remove the
entry from the spam list, instead of adding an exception.  Likewise, if
the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for a <command>spam</command> command
matches an entry on the <command>nospam</command> list, that nospam
entry will be removed. If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for
<command>nospam</command> is <quote>*</quote>, <emphasis>all entries on
both lists</emphasis> will be removed. This might be the default action
if you use <command>spam</command> and <command>nospam</command> in
conjunction with a <command>folder-hook</command>.
</para>

<para>
You can have as many <command>spam</command> or
<command>nospam</command> commands as you like.  You can even do your
own primitive <command>spam</command> detection within Mutt &mdash; for
example, if you consider all mail from <literal>MAILER-DAEMON</literal>
to be spam, you can use a <command>spam</command> command like this:
</para>

spam "^From: .*MAILER-DAEMON"       "999"

<para>
This command is used to set (and unset) <link
linkend="variables">configuration variables</link>.  There are four
basic types of variables: boolean, number, string and quadoption.
<emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variables can be <emphasis>set</emphasis>
(true) or <emphasis>unset</emphasis> (false).
<emphasis>number</emphasis> variables can be assigned a positive integer
value.  <emphasis>string</emphasis> variables consist of any number of
printable characters and must be enclosed in quotes if they contain
spaces or tabs.  You may also use the escape sequences <quote>\n</quote>
and <quote>\t</quote> for newline and tab, respectively.
<emphasis>quadoption</emphasis> variables are used to control whether or
not to be prompted for certain actions, or to specify a default action.
A value of <emphasis>yes</emphasis> will cause the action to be carried
out automatically as if you had answered yes to the question.
Similarly, a value of <emphasis>no</emphasis> will cause the action to
be carried out as if you had answered <quote>no.</quote> A value of
<emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> will cause a prompt with a default answer
of <quote>yes</quote> and <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis> will provide a
default answer of <quote>no.</quote>
</para>

<para>
Prefixing a variable with <quote>no</quote> will unset it.  Example:
<literal><command>set</command> noaskbcc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
For <emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variables, you may optionally prefix
the variable name with <literal>inv</literal> to toggle the value (on or
off).  This is useful when writing macros.  Example:
<literal><command>set</command> invsmart_wrap</literal>.
</para>

<para>
The <command>toggle</command> command automatically prepends the
<literal>inv</literal> prefix to all specified variables.
</para>

<para>
The <command>unset</command> command automatically prepends the
<literal>no</literal> prefix to all specified variables.
</para>

<para>
Using the <literal>&lt;enter-command&gt;</literal> function in the
<emphasis>index</emphasis> menu, you can query the value of a variable
by prefixing the name of the variable with a question mark:
</para>

<screen>
set ?allow_8bit
</screen>

<para>
The question mark is actually only required for boolean and quadoption
variables.
</para>

<para>
The <command>reset</command> command resets all given variables to the
compile time defaults (hopefully mentioned in this manual). If you use
the command <command>set</command> and prefix the variable with
<quote>&amp;</quote> this has the same behavior as the
<command>reset</command> command.
</para>

<para>
With the <command>reset</command> command there exists the special
variable <quote>all</quote>, which allows you to reset all variables to
their system defaults.

<title>User-Defined Variables</title>

<sect3 id="set-myvar-intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
Along with the variables listed in the <link
linkend="variables">Configuration variables</link> section, Mutt
supports user-defined variables with names starting with
<literal>my_</literal> as in, for example, <literal>my_cfgdir</literal>.
</para>

<para>
The <command>set</command> command either creates a custom
<literal>my_</literal> variable or changes its value if it does exist
already. The <command>unset</command> and <command>reset</command>
commands remove the variable entirely.
</para>

<para>
Since user-defined variables are expanded in the same way that
environment variables are (except for the <link
linkend="shell-escape">shell-escape</link> command and backtick
expansion), this feature can be used to make configuration files more
readable.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="set-myvar-examples">
<title>Examples</title>

<para>
The following example defines and uses the variable
<literal>my_cfgdir</literal> to abbreviate the calls of the <link
linkend="source"><command>source</command></link> command:
</para>

<example id="ex-myvar1">
<title>Using user-defined variables for config file readability</title>

set my_cfgdir = $HOME/mutt/config

source $my_cfgdir/hooks
source $my_cfgdir/macros
<emphasis role="comment"># more source commands...</emphasis>
</screen>
</example>

<para>
A custom variable can also be used in macros to backup the current value
of another variable. In the following example, the value of the <link
linkend="delete">$delete</link> is changed temporarily while its
original value is saved as <literal>my_delete</literal>.  After the
macro has executed all commands, the original value of <link
linkend="delete">$delete</link> is restored.
</para>

<example id="ex-myvar2">
<title>Using user-defined variables for backing up other config option values</title>

macro pager ,x '\
&lt;enter-command&gt;set my_delete=$delete&lt;enter&gt;\

...\
&lt;enter-command&gt;set delete=$my_delete&lt;enter&gt;'
</screen>
</example>

<para>
Since Mutt expands such values already when parsing the configuration
file(s), the value of <literal>$my_delete</literal> in the
last example would be the value of <link linkend="delete">$delete</link> exactly
as it was at that point during parsing the configuration file. If
another statement would change the value for <link linkend="delete">$delete</link>
later in the same or another file, it would have no effect on
<literal>$my_delete</literal>. However, the expansion can
be deferred to runtime, as shown in the next example, when escaping the
dollar sign.

<sect2 id="set-conversions">
<title>Type Conversions</title>

<para>
Variables are always assigned string values which Mutt parses into its
internal representation according to the type of the variable, for
example an integer number for numeric types. For all queries (including
$-expansion) the value is converted from its internal type back into
string. As a result, any variable can be assigned any value given that
its content is valid for the target. This also counts for custom
variables which are of type string. In case of parsing errors, Mutt will
print error messages. <xref linkend="ex-myvar4"/> demonstrates type
conversions.
</para>

<example id="ex-myvar4">
<title>Type conversions using variables</title>
<screen>
set my_lines = "5"                <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "5"</emphasis>
set pager_index_lines = $my_lines <emphasis role="comment"># value is integer 5</emphasis>

set my_sort = "date-received"     <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "date-received"</emphasis>
set sort = "last-$my_sort"        <emphasis role="comment"># value is sort last-date-received</emphasis>

set my_inc = $read_inc            <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "10" (default of $read_inc)</emphasis>
set my_foo = $my_inc              <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "10"</emphasis>
</screen>
</example>

<para>
These assignments are all valid. If, however, the value of
<literal>$my_lines</literal> would have been
<quote>five</quote> (or something else that cannot be parsed into a
number), the assignment to
<literal>$pager_index_lines</literal> would have
produced an error message.
</para>

<para>
Type conversion applies to all configuration commands which take
arguments. But please note that every expanded value of a variable is
considered just a single token. A working example is:
</para>

<screen>
set my_pattern = "~A"
set my_number = "10"

<emphasis role="comment"># same as: score ~A +10</emphasis>
score $my_pattern +$my_number</screen>

<para>
What does <emphasis>not</emphasis> work is:
</para>

<screen>
set my_mx = "+mailbox1 +mailbox2"
mailboxes $my_mx +mailbox3</screen>

<para>
because the value of <literal>$my_mx</literal> is interpreted as a
single mailbox named <quote>+mailbox1 +mailbox2</quote> and not two
distinct mailboxes.

<sect1 id="formatstrings">
<title>Format Strings</title>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-basics">
<title>Basic usage</title>

<para>
Format strings are a general concept you'll find in several locations
through the Mutt configuration, especially in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>, <link
linkend="pager-format">$pager_format</link>, <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>, and other related
variables. These can be very straightforward, and it's quite possible
you already know how to use them.
</para>

<para>
The most basic format string element is a percent symbol followed by
another character. For example, <literal>%s</literal> represents a
message's Subject: header in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. The
<quote>expandos</quote> available are documented with each format
variable, but there are general modifiers available with all formatting
expandos, too. Those are our concern here.
</para>

<para>
Some of the modifiers are borrowed right out of C (though you might know
them from Perl, Python, shell, or another language). These are the
<literal>[-]m.n</literal> modifiers, as in
<literal>%-12.12s</literal>. As with such programming languages, these
modifiers allow you to specify the minimum and maximum size of the
resulting string, as well as its justification. If the <quote>-</quote>
sign follows the percent, the string will be left-justified instead of
right-justified. If there's a number immediately following that, it's
the minimum amount of space the formatted string will occupy &mdash; if
it's naturally smaller than that, it will be padded out with spaces.  If
a decimal point and another number follow, that's the maximum space
allowable &mdash; the string will not be permitted to exceed that width,
no matter its natural size. Each of these three elements is optional, so
that all these are legal format strings: <literal>%-12s</literal>,
<literal>%4c</literal>, <literal>%.15F</literal> and
<literal>%-12.15L</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Mutt adds some other modifiers to format strings. If you use an equals
symbol (<literal>=</literal>) as a numeric prefix (like the minus
above), it will force the string to be centered within its minimum space
range. For example, <literal>%=14y</literal> will reserve 14 characters
for the %y expansion &mdash; that's the X-Label: header, in <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>. If the expansion results in
a string less than 14 characters, it will be centered in a 14-character
space.  If the X-Label for a message were <quote>test</quote>, that
expansion would look like
<quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</quote>.
</para>

<para>
There are two very little-known modifiers that affect the way that an
expando is replaced. If there is an underline (<quote>_</quote>)
character between any format modifiers (as above) and the expando
letter, it will expands in all lower case. And if you use a colon
(<quote>:</quote>), it will replace all decimal points with underlines.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-conditionals">
<title>Conditionals</title>

<para>
Depending on the format string variable, some of its sequences can be
used to optionally print a string if their value is nonzero. For
example, you may only want to see the number of flagged messages if such
messages exist, since zero is not particularly meaningful. To optionally
print a string based upon one of the above sequences, the following
construct is used:
</para>

<screen>
%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?</screen>

<para>
where <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is an expando, and
<emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> is the string you would like
printed if <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is nonzero.
<emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> may contain other sequences as well
as normal text, but you may not nest optional strings.
</para>

<para>
Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
new messages in a mailbox in <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>:
</para>

<screen>
%?n?%n new messages.?</screen>

<para>
You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
</para>

<screen>
%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?</screen>

<para>
If the value of <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is non-zero,
<emphasis>if_string</emphasis> will be expanded, otherwise
<emphasis>else_string</emphasis> will be expanded.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-filters">
<title>Filters</title>

<para>
Any format string ending in a vertical bar (<quote>|</quote>) will be
expanded and piped through the first word in the string, using spaces as
separator. The string returned will be used for display.  If the
returned string ends in %, it will be passed through the formatter a
second time. This allows the filter to generate a replacement format
string including % expandos.
</para>

<para>
All % expandos in a format string are expanded before the script is
called so that:
</para>

<example id="ex-fmtpipe">
<title>Using external filters in format strings</title>
<screen>
set status_format="script.sh '%r %f (%L)'|"
</screen>
</example>

<para>
will make Mutt expand <literal>%r</literal>, <literal>%f</literal> and
<literal>%L</literal> before calling the script. The example also shows
that arguments can be quoted: the script will receive the expanded
string between the single quotes as the only argument.
</para>

<para>
A practical example is the <literal>mutt_xtitle</literal> script
installed in the <literal>samples</literal> subdirectory of the Mutt
documentation: it can be used as filter for <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link> to set the current
terminal's title, if supported.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-padding">
<title>Padding</title>

<para>
In most format strings, Mutt supports different types of padding using
special %-expandos:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>%|X</literal></term>
<listitem>
<para>
When this occurs, Mutt will fill the rest of the line with the character
<literal>X</literal>. For example, filling the rest of the line with
dashes is done by setting:
</para>
<screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B: %?n?%n&amp;no? new messages %|-"</screen>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>%&gt;X</literal>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Since the previous expando stops at the end of line, there must be a way
to fill the gap between two items via the <literal>%&gt;X</literal>
expando: it puts as many characters <literal>X</literal> in between two
items so that the rest of the line will be right-justified. For example,
to not put the version string and hostname the above example on the left
but on the right and fill the gap with spaces, one might use (note the
space after <literal>%&gt;</literal>):
</para>
<screen>
set status_format = "%B: %?n?%n&amp;no? new messages %&gt; (%v on %h)"</screen>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>%*X</literal>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Normal right-justification will print everything to the left of the
<literal>%&gt;</literal>, displaying padding and whatever lies to the
right only if there's room. By contrast, <quote>soft-fill</quote> gives
priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space to display it and
showing padding only if there's still room. If necessary, soft-fill will
eat text leftwards to make room for rightward text. For example, to
right-justify the subject making sure as much as possible of it fits on
screen, one might use (note two spaces after <literal>%* </literal>: the
second ensures there's a space between the truncated right-hand side and
the subject):
</para>
<screen>
set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&amp;%4c?)%*  %s"</screen>

<title>Advanced Usage</title>

<sect1 id="charset-handling">
<title>Character Set Handling</title>

<para>
A <quote>character set</quote> is basically a mapping between bytes and
glyphs and implies a certain character encoding scheme. For example, for
the ISO 8859 family of character sets, an encoding of 8bit per character
is used. For the Unicode character set, different character encodings
may be used, UTF-8 being the most popular. In UTF-8, a character is
represented using a variable number of bytes ranging from 1 to 4.
</para>

<para>
Since Mutt is a command-line tool run from a shell, and delegates
certain tasks to external tools (such as an editor for composing/editing
messages), all of these tools need to agree on a character set and
encoding. There exists no way to reliably deduce the character set a
plain text file has. Interoperability is gained by the use of
well-defined environment variables. The full set can be printed by
issuing <literal>locale</literal> on the command line.
</para>

<para>
Upon startup, Mutt determines the character set on its own using
routines that inspect locale-specific environment variables. Therefore,
it is generally not necessary to set the <literal>$charset</literal>
variable in Mutt. It may even be counter-productive as Mutt uses system
and library functions that derive the character set themselves and on
which Mutt has no influence. It's safest to let Mutt work out the locale
setup itself.
</para>

<para>
If you happen to work with several character sets on a regular basis,
it's highly advisable to use Unicode and an UTF-8 locale. Unicode can
represent nearly all characters in a message at the same time.  When not
using a Unicode locale, it may happen that you receive messages with
characters not representable in your locale. When displaying such a
message, or replying to or forwarding it, information may get lost
possibly rendering the message unusable (not only for you but also for
the recipient, this breakage is not reversible as lost information
cannot be guessed).
</para>

<para>
A Unicode locale makes all conversions superfluous which eliminates the
risk of conversion errors. It also eliminates potentially wrong
expectations about the character set between Mutt and external programs.
</para>

<para>
The terminal emulator used also must be properly configured for the
current locale. Terminal emulators usually do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
derive the locale from environment variables, they need to be configured
separately. If the terminal is incorrectly configured, Mutt may display
random and unexpected characters (question marks, octal codes, or just
random glyphs), format strings may not work as expected, you may not be
abled to enter non-ascii characters, and possible more.  Data is always
represented using bytes and so a correct setup is very important as to
the machine, all character sets <quote>look</quote> the same.
</para>

Warning: A mismatch between what system and library functions think the
locale is and what Mutt was told what the locale is may make it behave
badly with non-ascii input: it will fail at seemingly random places.
This warning is to be taken seriously since not only local mail handling
may suffer: sent messages may carry wrong character set information the
<emphasis>receiver</emphasis> has too deal with. The need to set
<literal>$charset</literal> directly in most cases points at terminal
and environment variable setup problems, not Mutt problems.

<title>Regular Expressions</title>

<para>
All string patterns in Mutt including those in more complex <link
linkend="patterns">patterns</link> must be specified using regular
expressions (regexp) in the <quote>POSIX extended</quote> syntax (which
is more or less the syntax used by egrep and GNU awk).  For your
convenience, we have included below a brief description of this syntax.
</para>

<para>
The search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at least one upper
case letter, and case insensitive otherwise.
</para>

<note>
<para>
<quote>\</quote> must be quoted if used for a regular expression in an
initialization command: <quote>\\</quote>.
</para>
</note>

<para>
A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either " or ' which
is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space character.
See <xref linkend="muttrc-syntax"/> for more information on " and '
delimiter processing.  To match a literal " or ' you must preface it
with \ (backslash).
</para>
</note>

<para>
The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a
single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits,
are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with
special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.
</para>

<para>
The period <quote>.</quote> matches any single character.  The caret
<quote>^</quote> and the dollar sign <quote>$</quote> are metacharacters
that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
line.
</para>

<para>
A list of characters enclosed by <quote>[</quote> and <quote>]</quote>
matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the
list is a caret <quote>^</quote> then it matches any character
<emphasis>not</emphasis> in the list.  For example, the regular
expression <emphasis>[0123456789]</emphasis> matches any single digit.
A range of ASCII characters may be specified by giving the first and
last characters, separated by a hyphen <quote>-</quote>.  Most
metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists.  To include a
literal <quote>]</quote> place it first in the list.  Similarly, to
include a literal <quote>^</quote> place it anywhere but first.
Finally, to include a literal hyphen <quote>-</quote> place it last.
</para>

<para>
Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Character classes
consist of <quote>[:</quote>, a keyword denoting the class, and
<quote>:]</quote>.  The following classes are defined by the POSIX
standard in
<xref linkend="posix-regex-char-classes"/>

<para>
A character class is only valid in a regular expression inside the
brackets of a character list.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic
names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the
bracket list. For example, <emphasis>[[:digit:]]</emphasis> is
equivalent to <emphasis>[0-9]</emphasis>.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.  These
apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols (called
collating elements) that are represented with more than one character,
as well as several characters that are equivalent for collating or
sorting purposes:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>Collating Symbols</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A collating symbol is a multi-character collating element enclosed in
<quote>[.</quote> and <quote>.]</quote>.  For example, if
<quote>ch</quote> is a collating element, then
<emphasis>[[.ch.]]</emphasis> is a regexp that matches this collating
element, while <emphasis>[ch]</emphasis> is a regexp that matches either
<quote>c</quote> or <quote>h</quote>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Equivalence Classes</term>
<listitem>
<para>
An equivalence class is a locale-specific name for a list of characters
that are equivalent. The name is enclosed in <quote>[=</quote> and
<quote>=]</quote>.  For example, the name <quote>e</quote> might be used
to represent all of <quote>e</quote> with grave
(<quote>&egrave;</quote>), <quote>e</quote> with acute
(<quote>&eacute;</quote>) and <quote>e</quote>.  In this case,
<emphasis>[[=e=]]</emphasis> is a regexp that matches any of:
<quote>e</quote> with grave (<quote>&egrave;</quote>), <quote>e</quote>
with acute (<quote>&eacute;</quote>) and <quote>e</quote>.

<para>
Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.
</para>

<para>
Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator
<quote>|</quote>; the resulting regular expression matches any string
matching either subexpression.

<para>
Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules.

</para>

<para>
Special attention has to be payed when using regular expressions inside
of patterns.  Specifically, Mutt's parser for these patterns will strip
one level of backslash (<quote>\</quote>), which is normally used for
quoting.  If it is your intention to use a backslash in the regular
expression, you will need to use two backslashes instead
(<quote>\\</quote>). You can force Mutt to treat
<emphasis>EXPR</emphasis> as a simple string instead of a regular
expression by using = instead of ~ in the pattern name. For example,
<literal>=b *.*</literal> will find all messages that contain the
literal string <quote>*.*</quote>. Simple string matches are less
powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably faster. This
is especially true for IMAP folders, because string matches can be
performed on the server instead of by fetching every message. IMAP
treats <literal>=h</literal> specially: it must be of the form
<quote>header: substring</quote> and will not partially match header
names. The substring part may be omitted if you simply wish to find
messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.
</para>

<para>
Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably c, C, p, P and t) match if
there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make sure
that all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your pattern
with <quote>^</quote>.  This example matches all mails which only has
recipients from Germany.

<sect2 id="simple-searches">
<title>Simple Searches</title>

<para>
Mutt supports two versions of so called <quote>simple
searches</quote>. These are issued if the query entered for searching,
limiting and similar operations does not seem to contain a valid pattern
modifier (i.e. it does not contain one of these characters:
<quote>~</quote>, <quote>=</quote> or <quote>%</quote>). If the query is
supposed to contain one of these special characters, they must be
escaped by prepending a backslash (<quote>\</quote>).
</para>

<para>
The first type is by checking whether the query string equals
a keyword case-insensitively from <xref linkend="tab-simplesearch-keywords"/>:
If that is the case, Mutt will use the shown pattern modifier instead.
If a keyword would conflict with your search keyword, you need to turn
it into a regular expression to avoid matching the keyword table. For
example, if you want to find all messages matching <quote>flag</quote>
(using <link linkend="simple-search">$simple_search</link>)
but don't want to match flagged messages, simply search for
<quote><literal>[f]lag</literal></quote>.

<title>Using Tags</title>

<para>
Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of messages
all at once rather than one at a time.  An example might be to save
messages to a mailing list to a separate folder, or to delete all
messages with a given subject.  To tag all messages matching a pattern,
use the <literal>&lt;tag-pattern&gt;</literal> function, which is bound
to <quote>shift-T</quote> by default.  Or you can select individual
messages by hand using the <literal>&lt;tag-message&gt;</literal>
function, which is bound to <quote>t</quote> by default.  See <link
linkend="patterns">patterns</link> for Mutt's pattern matching syntax.
</para>

<para>
Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the
<quote>tag-prefix</quote> operator, which is the <quote>;</quote>
(semicolon) key by default.  When the <quote>tag-prefix</quote> operator
is used, the <emphasis>next</emphasis> operation will be applied to all
tagged messages if that operation can be used in that manner.  If the
<link linkend="auto-tag">$auto_tag</link> variable is set, the next
operation applies to the tagged messages automatically, without
requiring the <quote>tag-prefix</quote>.

tagged messages, Mutt will <quote>eat</quote> the rest of the macro to
abort it's execution.  Mutt will stop <quote>eating</quote> the macro
when it encounters the <literal>&lt;end-cond&gt;</literal> operator;
after this operator the rest of the macro will be executed as normal.

<title>Using Hooks</title>

<para>
A <emphasis>hook</emphasis> is a concept found in many other programs
which allows you to execute arbitrary commands before performing some
operation.  For example, you may wish to tailor your configuration based
upon which mailbox you are reading, or to whom you are sending mail.  In
the Mutt world, a <emphasis>hook</emphasis> consists of a <link
linkend="regexp">regular expression</link> or <link
linkend="patterns">pattern</link> along with a configuration
option/command.  See:

</para>

<note>
<para>
If a hook changes configuration settings, these changes remain effective
until the end of the current Mutt session. As this is generally not
desired, a <quote>default</quote> hook needs to be added before all
other hooks of that type to restore configuration defaults.
</para>
</note>

<example id="ex-default-hook">

</para>

<sect2 id="pattern-hook" xreflabel="Message Matching in Hooks">
<title>Message Matching in Hooks</title>

<para>
Hooks that act upon messages (<command>message-hook</command>,
<command>reply-hook</command>, <command>send-hook</command>,
<command>send2-hook</command>, <command>save-hook</command>,
<command>fcc-hook</command>) are evaluated in a slightly different
manner. For the other types of hooks, a <link linkend="regexp">regular
expression</link> is sufficient.  But in dealing with messages a finer
grain of control is needed for matching since for different purposes you
want to match different criteria.
</para>

<para>
Mutt allows the use of the <link linkend="patterns">search
pattern</link> language for matching messages in hook commands.  This
works in exactly the same way as it would when
<emphasis>limiting</emphasis> or <emphasis>searching</emphasis> the
mailbox, except that you are restricted to those operators which match
information Mutt extracts from the header of the message (i.e., from,
to, cc, date, subject, etc.).
</para>

<para>
For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon sending
mail to a specific address, you could do something like:
</para>

<screen>
send-hook '~t ^me@cs\.hmc\.edu$' 'my_hdr From: Mutt User &lt;user@host&gt;'
</screen>

<para>
which would execute the given command when sending mail to
<emphasis>me@cs.hmc.edu</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using
the full searching language.  You can still specify a simple
<emphasis>regular expression</emphasis> like the other hooks, in which
case Mutt will translate your pattern into the full language, using the
translation specified by the <link
linkend="default-hook">$default_hook</link> variable.  The pattern is
translated at the time the hook is declared, so the value of <link
linkend="default-hook">$default_hook</link> that is in effect at that
time will be used.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="query">
<title>External Address Queries</title>

<para>
Mutt supports connecting to external directory databases such as LDAP,
ph/qi, bbdb, or NIS through a wrapper script which connects to Mutt
using a simple interface.  Using the <link
linkend="query-command">$query_command</link> variable, you specify the
wrapper command to use.  For example:
</para>

<screen>
set query_command = "mutt_ldap_query.pl %s"
</screen>

<para>
The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line.  It
should return a one line message, then each matching response on a
single line, each line containing a tab separated address then name then
some other optional information.  On error, or if there are no matching
addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a one line error message.
</para>

<para>
An example multiple response output:
</para>

<screen>

blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
roessler@does-not-exist.org        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp
</screen>

<para>
There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of Mutt.  One
is to do a query from the index menu using the
<literal>&lt;query&gt;</literal> function (default: Q).  This will
prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will list the
matching responses.  From the query menu, you can select addresses to
create aliases, or to mail.  You can tag multiple addresses to mail,
start a new query, or have a new query appended to the current
responses.
</para>

<para>
The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address
completion, similar to the alias completion.  In any prompt for address
entry, you can use the <literal>&lt;complete-query&gt;</literal>
function (default: ^T) to run a query based on the current address you
have typed.  Like aliases, Mutt will look for what you have typed back
to the last space or comma.  If there is a single response for that
query, Mutt will expand the address in place.  If there are multiple
responses, Mutt will activate the query menu.  At the query menu, you
can select one or more addresses to be added to the prompt.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="mailbox-formats">
<title>Mailbox Formats</title>

<para>
Mutt supports reading and writing of four different local mailbox
formats: mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.  The mailbox type is auto detected,
so there is no need to use a flag for different mailbox types.  When
creating new mailboxes, Mutt uses the default specified with the <link
linkend="mbox-type">$mbox_type</link> variable. A short description of
the formats follows.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>mbox</emphasis>.  This is a widely used mailbox format for
UNIX.  All messages are stored in a single file.  Each message has a
line of the form:
</para>

<screen>
From me@cs.hmc.edu Fri, 11 Apr 1997 11:44:56 PST
</screen>

<para>
to denote the start of a new message (this is often referred to as the
<quote>From_</quote> line). The mbox format requires mailbox locking, is
prone to mailbox corruption with concurrently writing clients or
misinterpreted From_ lines. Depending on the environment, new mail
detection can be unreliable. Mbox folders are fast to open and easy to
archive.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>MMDF</emphasis>.  This is a variant of the
<emphasis>mbox</emphasis> format.  Each message is surrounded by lines
containing <quote>^A^A^A^A</quote> (four times control-A's). The same
problems as for mbox apply (also with finding the right message
separator as four control-A's may appear in message bodies).
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>MH</emphasis>. A radical departure from
<emphasis>mbox</emphasis> and <emphasis>MMDF</emphasis>, a mailbox
consists of a directory and each message is stored in a separate file.
The filename indicates the message number (however, this is may not
correspond to the message number Mutt displays). Deleted messages are
renamed with a comma (<quote>,</quote>) prepended to the filename. Mutt
detects this type of mailbox by looking for either
<literal>.mh_sequences</literal> or <literal>.xmhcache</literal> files
(needed to distinguish normal directories from MH mailboxes). MH is more
robust with concurrent clients writing the mailbox, but still may suffer
from lost flags; message corruption is less likely to occur than with
mbox/mmdf. It's usually slower to open compared to mbox/mmdf since many
small files have to be read (Mutt provides <xref
linkend="header-caching"/> to greatly speed this process up).  Depending
on the environment, MH is not very disk-space efficient.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Maildir</emphasis>.  The newest of the mailbox formats, used
by the Qmail MTA (a replacement for sendmail).  Similar to
<emphasis>MH</emphasis>, except that it adds three subdirectories of the
mailbox: <emphasis>tmp</emphasis>, <emphasis>new</emphasis> and
<emphasis>cur</emphasis>.  Filenames for the messages are chosen in such
a way they are unique, even when two programs are writing the mailbox
over NFS, which means that no file locking is needed and corruption is
very unlikely. Maildir maybe slower to open without caching in Mutt, it
too is not very disk-space efficient depending on the environment. Since
no additional files are used for metadata (which is embedded in the
message filenames) and Maildir is locking-free, it's easy to sync across
different machines using file-level synchronization tools.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="shortcuts">
<title>Mailbox Shortcuts</title>

<para>
There are a number of built in shortcuts which refer to specific
mailboxes.  These shortcuts can be used anywhere you are prompted for a

</sect1>

<sect1 id="using-lists">
<title>Handling Mailing Lists</title>

<para>
Mutt has a few configuration options that make dealing with large
amounts of mail easier.  The first thing you must do is to let Mutt know
what addresses you consider to be mailing lists (technically this does
not have to be a mailing list, but that is what it is most often used
for), and what lists you are subscribed to.  This is accomplished
through the use of the <link linkend="lists"><command>lists</command>
and <command>subscribe</command></link> commands in your
<literal>.muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Now that Mutt knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several
things, the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list
through which you received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in the
<emphasis>index</emphasis> menu display.  This is useful to distinguish
between personal and list mail in the same mailbox.  In the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable, the expando
<quote>%L</quote> will print the string <quote>To &lt;list&gt;</quote>
when <quote>list</quote> appears in the <quote>To</quote> field, and
<quote>Cc &lt;list&gt;</quote> when it appears in the <quote>Cc</quote>
field (otherwise it prints the name of the author).
</para>

<para>
Often times the <quote>To</quote> and <quote>Cc</quote> fields in
mailing list messages tend to get quite large. Most people do not bother
to remove the author of the message they reply to from the list,
resulting in two or more copies being sent to that person.  The
<literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal> function, which by default is
bound to <quote>L</quote> in the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu and
<emphasis>pager</emphasis>, helps reduce the clutter by only replying to
the known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as
specified by <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>, see below).
</para>

<para>
Mutt also supports the <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header.  When
you send a message to a list of recipients which includes one or several
subscribed mailing lists, and if the <link
linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link> option is set, Mutt will
generate a Mail-Followup-To header which contains all the recipients to
whom you send this message, but not your address. This indicates that
group-replies or list-replies (also known as <quote>followups</quote>)
to this message should only be sent to the original recipients of the
message, and not separately to you - you'll receive your copy through
one of the mailing lists you are subscribed to.
</para>

<para>
Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which has
a <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header, Mutt will respect this
header if the <link
linkend="honor-followup-to">$honor_followup_to</link> configuration
variable is set.  Using <link linkend="list-reply">list-reply</link>
will in this case also make sure that the reply goes to the mailing
list, even if it's not specified in the list of recipients in the
<literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>.
</para>

<note>
<para>
When header editing is enabled, you can create a
<literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header manually.  Mutt will only
auto-generate this header if it doesn't exist when you send the message.
</para>
</note>

<para>
The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate a
<quote>Reply-To</quote> field which points back to the mailing list
address rather than the author of the message.  This can create problems
when trying to reply directly to the author in private, since most mail
clients will automatically reply to the address given in the
<quote>Reply-To</quote> field.  Mutt uses the <link
linkend="reply-to">$reply_to</link> variable to help decide which
address to use.  If set to <emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> or
<emphasis>ask-no</emphasis>, you will be prompted as to whether or not
you would like to use the address given in the <quote>Reply-To</quote>
field, or reply directly to the address given in the <quote>From</quote>
field.  When set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, the
<quote>Reply-To</quote> field will be used when present.
</para>

<para>
The <quote>X-Label:</quote> header field can be used to further identify
mailing lists or list subject matter (or just to annotate messages
individually).  The <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>
variable's <quote>%y</quote> and <quote>%Y</quote> expandos can be used
to expand <quote>X-Label:</quote> fields in the index, and Mutt's
pattern-matcher can match regular expressions to <quote>X-Label:</quote>
fields with the <quote>~y</quote> selector.  <quote>X-Label:</quote> is
not a standard message header field, but it can easily be inserted by
procmail and other mail filtering agents.
</para>

<para>
Lastly, Mutt has the ability to <link linkend="sort">sort</link> the
mailbox into <link linkend="threads">threads</link>.  A thread is a
group of messages which all relate to the same subject.  This is usually
organized into a tree-like structure where a message and all of its
replies are represented graphically.  If you've ever used a threaded
news client, this is the same concept.  It makes dealing with large
volume mailing lists easier because you can easily delete uninteresting
threads and quickly find topics of value.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="new-mail">
<title>New Mail Detection</title>

<para>
Mutt supports setups with multiple folders, allowing all of them to be
monitored for new mail (see <xref linkend="mailboxes"/> for details).
</para>

<sect2 id="new-mail-formats">
<title>How New Mail Detection Works</title>

<para>
For Mbox and Mmdf folders, new mail is detected by comparing access
and/or modification times of files: Mutt assumes a folder has new mail
if it wasn't accessed after it was last modified. Utilities like
<literal>biff</literal> or <literal>frm</literal> or any other program
which accesses the mailbox might cause Mutt to never detect new mail for
that mailbox if they do not properly reset the access time. Other
possible causes of Mutt not detecting new mail in these folders are
backup tools (updating access times) or filesystems mounted without
access time update support (for Linux systems, see the
<literal>relatime</literal> option).
</para>

<note>
<para>
Contrary to older Mutt releases, it now maintains the new mail status of
a folder by properly resetting the access time if the folder contains at
least one message which is neither read, nor deleted, nor marked as old.
</para>
</note>

<para>
In cases where new mail detection for Mbox or Mmdf folders appears to be
unreliable, the <link linkend="check-mbox-size">$check_mbox_size</link>
option can be used to make Mutt track and consult file sizes for new
mail detection instead which won't work for size-neutral changes.
</para>

<para>
New mail for Maildir is assumed if there is one message in the
<literal>new/</literal> subdirectory which is not marked deleted (see
<link linkend="maildir-trash">$maildir_trash</link>). For MH folders, a
mailbox is considered having new mail if there's at least one message in
the <quote>unseen</quote> sequence as specified by <link
linkend="mh-seq-unseen">$mh_seq_unseen</link>.
</para>

<para>
Mutt does not poll POP3 folders for new mail, it only periodically
checks the currently opened folder (if it's a POP3 folder).
</para>

<para>
For IMAP, by default Mutt uses recent message counts provided by the
server to detect new mail. If the <link
linkend="imap-idle">$imap_idle</link> option is set, it'll use the IMAP
IDLE extension if advertised by the server.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="new-mail-polling">
<title>Polling For New Mail</title>

<para>
When in the index menu and being idle (also see <link
linkend="timeout">$timeout</link>), Mutt periodically checks for new
mail in all folders which have been configured via the
<command>mailboxes</command> command. The interval depends on the folder
type: for local/IMAP folders it consults <link
linkend="mail-check">$mail_check</link> and <link
linkend="pop-checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</link> for POP folders.
</para>

<para>
Outside the index menu the directory browser supports checking for new
mail using the <literal>&lt;check-new&gt;</literal> function which is
unbound by default. Pressing TAB will bring up a menu showing the files
specified by the <command>mailboxes</command> command, and indicate
which contain new messages. Mutt will automatically enter this mode when
invoked from the command line with the <literal>-y</literal> option.
</para>

<para>
For the pager, index and directory browser menus, Mutt contains the
<literal>&lt;buffy-list&gt;</literal> function (bound to
<quote>.</quote> by default) which will print a list of folders with new
mail in the command line at the bottom of the screen.
</para>

<para>
For the index, by default Mutt displays the number of mailboxes with new
mail in the status bar, please refer to the <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link> variable for details.
</para>

<para>
When changing folders, Mutt fills the prompt with the first folder from
the mailboxes list containing new mail (if any), pressing
<literal>&lt;Space&gt;</literal> will cycle through folders with new
mail.  The (by default unbound) function
<literal>&lt;next-unread-mailbox&gt;</literal> in the index can be used
to immediately open the next folder with unread mail (if any).

Mutt has the ability to dynamically restructure threads that are broken

annoyances which make it hard to follow a discussion.
</para>

<sect2 id="link-threads">
<title>Linking Threads</title>

<para>
Some mailers tend to <quote>forget</quote> to correctly set the
<quote>In-Reply-To:</quote> and <quote>References:</quote> headers when
replying to a message. This results in broken discussions because Mutt
has not enough information to guess the correct threading.  You can fix
this by tagging the reply, then moving to the parent message and using
the <literal>&lt;link-threads&gt;</literal> function (bound to &amp; by
default). The reply will then be connected to this parent message.
</para>

<para>
You can also connect multiple children at once, tagging them and using
the <literal>&lt;tag-prefix&gt;</literal> command (<quote>;</quote>) or

Quite a bit of effort has been made to make Mutt the premier text-mode

the discerning MIME user requires, and the conformance to the standards
wherever possible.  When configuring Mutt for MIME, there are two extra
types of configuration files which Mutt uses.  One is the
<literal>mime.types</literal> file, which contains the mapping of file
extensions to IANA MIME types.  The other is the
<literal>mailcap</literal> file, which specifies the external commands
to use for handling specific MIME types.
</para>

<title>Using MIME in Mutt</title>

<sect2 id="mime-overview">
<title>MIME Overview</title>

<para>
MIME is short for <quote>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension</quote>
and describes mechanisms to internationalize and structure mail
messages. Before the introduction of MIME, messages had a single text
part and were limited to us-ascii header and content. With MIME,
messages can have attachments (and even attachments which itself have
attachments and thus form a tree structure), nearly arbitrary characters
can be used for sender names, recipients and subjects.
</para>

<para>
Besides the handling of non-ascii characters in message headers, to Mutt
the most important aspect of MIME are so-called MIME types. These are
constructed using a <emphasis>major</emphasis> and
<emphasis>minor</emphasis> type separated by a forward slash.  These
specify details about the content that follows. Based upon these, Mutt
decides how to handle this part. The most popular major type is
<quote><literal>text</literal></quote> with minor types for plain text,
HTML and various other formats. Major types also exist for images,
audio, video and of course general application data (e.g. to separate
cryptographically signed data with a signature, send office documents,
and in general arbitrary binary data). There's also the
<literal>multipart</literal> major type which represents the root of a
subtree of MIME parts. A list of supported MIME types can be found in
<xref linkend="supported-mime-types"/>.
</para>

<para>
MIME also defines a set of encoding schemes for transporting MIME
content over the network: <literal>7bit</literal>,
<literal>8bit</literal>, <literal>quoted-printable</literal>,
<literal>base64</literal> and <literal>binary</literal>. There're some
rules when to choose what for encoding headers and/or body (if needed),
and Mutt will in general make a good choice.
</para>

<para>
Mutt does most of MIME encoding/decoding behind the scenes to form
messages conforming to MIME on the sending side. On reception, it can be
flexibly configured as to how what MIME structure is displayed (and if
it's displayed): these decisions are based on the content's MIME type.
There are three areas/menus in dealing with MIME: the pager (while
viewing a message), the attachment menu and the compose menu.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="mime-pager">
<title>Viewing MIME Messages in the Pager</title>

<para>
When you select a message from the index and view it in the pager, Mutt
decodes as much of a message as possible to a text representation.  Mutt
internally supports a number of MIME types, including the
<literal>text</literal> major type (with all minor types), the
<literal>message/rfc822</literal> (mail messages) type and some
<literal>multipart</literal> types. In addition, it recognizes a variety
of PGP MIME types, including PGP/MIME and
<literal>application/pgp</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Mutt will denote attachments with a couple lines describing them.
These lines are of the form:
</para>

<screen>
[-- Attachment #1: Description --]
[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 10000 --]
</screen>

<para>
Where the <emphasis>Description</emphasis> is the description or
filename given for the attachment, and the <emphasis>Encoding</emphasis>
is one of the already mentioned content encodings.
</para>

<para>
If Mutt cannot deal with a MIME type, it will display a message like:
</para>

<screen>
[-- image/gif is unsupported (use 'v' to view this part) --]
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="attach-menu">
<title>The Attachment Menu</title>

<para>
The default binding for <literal>&lt;view-attachments&gt;</literal> is
<quote>v</quote>, which displays the attachment menu for a message.  The
attachment menu displays a list of the attachments in a message.  From
the attachment menu, you can save, print, pipe, delete, and view
attachments.  You can apply these operations to a group of attachments
at once, by tagging the attachments and by using the
<literal>&lt;tag-prefix&gt;</literal> operator.  You can also reply to
the current message from this menu, and only the current attachment (or
the attachments tagged) will be quoted in your reply.  You can view
attachments as text, or view them using the mailcap viewer definition
(the mailcap mechanism is explained later in detail).
</para>

<para>
Finally, you can apply the usual message-related functions (like <link
linkend="resend-message"><literal>&lt;resend-message&gt;</literal></link>,
and the <literal>&lt;reply&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;forward&gt;</literal> functions) to attachments of type
<literal>message/rfc822</literal>.
</para>

<para>
See table <xref linkend="tab-attachment-bindings"/> for all available
functions.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="compose-menu">
<title>The Compose Menu</title>

<para>
The compose menu is the menu you see before you send a message.  It
allows you to edit the recipient list, the subject, and other aspects of
your message.  It also contains a list of the attachments of your
message, including the main body.  From this menu, you can print, copy,
filter, pipe, edit, compose, review, and rename an attachment or a list
of tagged attachments.  You can also modifying the attachment
information, notably the type, encoding and description.
</para>

<para>
Attachments appear as follows by default:
</para>

<screen>
- 1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1K]           /tmp/mutt-euler-8082-0 &lt;no description&gt;
  2 [applica/x-gunzip, base64, 422K] ~/src/mutt-0.85.tar.gz &lt;no description&gt;
</screen>

<para>
The <quote>-</quote> denotes that Mutt will delete the file after
sending (or postponing, or canceling) the message.  It can be toggled
with the <literal>&lt;toggle-unlink&gt;</literal> command (default: u).
The next field is the MIME content-type, and can be changed with the
<literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal> command (default: ^T).  The next
field is the encoding for the attachment, which allows a binary message
to be encoded for transmission on 7bit links.  It can be changed with
the <literal>&lt;edit-encoding&gt;</literal> command (default: ^E).  The
next field is the size of the attachment, rounded to kilobytes or
megabytes.  The next field is the filename, which can be changed with
the <literal>&lt;rename-file&gt;</literal> command (default: R).  The
final field is the description of the attachment, and can be changed
with the <literal>&lt;edit-description&gt;</literal> command (default:
d). See <link linkend="attach-format">$attach_format</link> for a full
list of available expandos to format this display to your needs.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="mime-types">
<title>MIME Type Configuration with <literal>mime.types</literal></title>

<para>
To get most out of MIME, it's important that a MIME part's content type
matches the content as closely as possible so that the recipient's
client can automatically select the right viewer for the
content. However, there's no reliable for Mutt to know how to detect
every possible file type. Instead, it uses a simple plain text mapping
file that specifies what file extension corresponds to what MIME
type. This file is called <literal>mime.types</literal>.
</para>

<para>
When you add an attachment to your mail message, Mutt searches your
personal <literal>mime.types</literal> file at
<literal>$HOME/.mime.types</literal>, and then the system
<literal>mime.types</literal> file at
<literal>/usr/local/share/mutt/mime.types</literal> or
<literal>/etc/mime.types</literal>
</para>

<para>
Each line starts with the full MIME type, followed by a space and
space-separated list of file extensions. For example you could use:
</para>

<example id="ex-mime-types">
<title><literal>mime.types</literal></title>
<screen>
application/postscript          ps eps
application/pgp                 pgp
audio/x-aiff                    aif aifc aiff
</screen>
</example>

<para>
A sample <literal>mime.types</literal> file comes with the Mutt
distribution, and should contain most of the MIME types you are likely
to use.
</para>

<para>
If Mutt can not determine the MIME type by the extension of the file you
attach, it will look at the file.  If the file is free of binary
information, Mutt will assume that the file is plain text, and mark it
as <literal>text/plain</literal>.  If the file contains binary
information, then Mutt will mark it as
<literal>application/octet-stream</literal>.  You can change the MIME
type that Mutt assigns to an attachment by using the
<literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal> command from the compose menu
(default: ^T), see <xref linkend="supported-mime-types"/> for supported
major types. Mutt recognizes all of these if the appropriate entry is
found in the <literal>mime.types</literal> file. Non-recognized mime
types should only be used if the recipient of the message is likely to
be expecting such attachments.

<sect1 id="mailcap">
<title>MIME Viewer Configuration with Mailcap</title>

<para>
Mutt supports RFC 1524 MIME Configuration, in particular the Unix
specific format specified in Appendix A of RFC 1524.  This file format
is commonly referred to as the <quote>mailcap</quote> format.  Many MIME
compliant programs utilize the mailcap format, allowing you to specify
handling for all MIME types in one place for all programs.  Programs
known to use this format include Firefox, lynx and metamail.
</para>

<para>
In order to handle various MIME types that Mutt doesn't have built-in
support for, it parses a series of external configuration files to find
an external handler. The default search string for these files is a
colon delimited list containing the following files:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para><literal>$HOME/.mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>$PKGDATADIR/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>$SYSCONFDIR/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>/etc/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>/usr/etc/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>/usr/local/etc/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
where <literal>$HOME</literal> is your home directory. The
<literal>$PKGDATADIR</literal> and the <literal>$SYSCONFDIR</literal>
directories depend on where Mutt is installed: the former is the default
for shared data, the latter for system configuration files.
</para>

<para>
The default search path can be obtained by running the following
command:
</para>

<screen>
mutt -nF /dev/null -Q mailcap_path
</screen>

<para>
In particular, the metamail distribution will install a mailcap file,
usually as <literal>/usr/local/etc/mailcap</literal>, which contains
some baseline entries.
</para>

<sect2 id="mailcap-basics">
<title>The Basics of the Mailcap File</title>

<para>
A mailcap file consists of a series of lines which are comments, blank,
or definitions.
</para>

<para>
A comment line consists of a # character followed by anything you want.
</para>

<para>
A blank line is blank.
</para>

<para>
A definition line consists of a content type, a view command, and any
number of optional fields.  Each field of a definition line is divided
by a semicolon <quote>;</quote> character.
</para>

<para>
The content type is specified in the MIME standard
<quote>type/subtype</quote> notation.  For example,
<literal>text/plain</literal>, <literal>text/html</literal>,
<literal>image/gif</literal>, etc.  In addition, the mailcap format
includes two formats for wildcards, one using the special
<quote>*</quote> subtype, the other is the implicit wild, where you only
include the major type.  For example, <literal>image/*</literal>, or
<literal>video</literal> will match all image types and video types,
respectively.
</para>

<para>
The view command is a Unix command for viewing the type specified. There
are two different types of commands supported. The default is to send
the body of the MIME message to the command on stdin. You can change
this behavior by using <literal>%s</literal> as a parameter to your view
command.  This will cause Mutt to save the body of the MIME message to a
temporary file, and then call the view command with the
<literal>%s</literal> replaced by the name of the temporary file. In
both cases, Mutt will turn over the terminal to the view program until
the program quits, at which time Mutt will remove the temporary file if
it exists. This means that mailcap does <emphasis>not</emphasis> work
out of the box with programs which detach themselves from the terminal
right after starting, like <literal>open</literal> on Mac OS X. In order
to nevertheless use these programs with mailcap, you probably need
custom shell scripts.
</para>

<para>
So, in the simplest form, you can send a <literal>text/plain</literal>
message to the external pager more on standard input:
</para>

<screen>
text/plain; more
</screen>

<para>
Or, you could send the message as a file:
</para>

<screen>
text/plain; more %s
</screen>

<para>
Perhaps you would like to use lynx to interactively view a
<literal>text/html</literal> message:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx %s
</screen>

<para>
In this case, lynx does not support viewing a file from standard input,
so you must use the <literal>%s</literal> syntax.
</para>

<note>
<para>
<emphasis>Some older versions of lynx contain a bug where they will
check the mailcap file for a viewer for <literal>text/html</literal>.
They will find the line which calls lynx, and run it.  This causes lynx
to continuously spawn itself to view the object.</emphasis>
</para>
</note>

<para>
On the other hand, maybe you don't want to use lynx interactively, you
just want to have it convert the <literal>text/html</literal> to
<literal>text/plain</literal>, then you can use:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx -dump %s | more
</screen>

<para>
Perhaps you wish to use lynx to view <literal>text/html</literal> files,
and a pager on all other text formats, then you would use the following:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx %s
text/*; more
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="secure-mailcap">
<title>Secure Use of Mailcap</title>

<para>
The interpretation of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME parameters
can lead to security problems in general.  Mutt tries to quote
parameters in expansion of <literal>%s</literal> syntaxes properly, and
avoids risky characters by substituting them, see the <link
linkend="mailcap-sanitize">$mailcap_sanitize</link> variable.
</para>

<para>
Although Mutt's procedures to invoke programs with mailcap seem to be
safe, there are other applications parsing mailcap, maybe taking less
care of it.  Therefore you should pay attention to the following rules:
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Keep the %-expandos away from shell quoting.</emphasis> Don't
quote them with single or double quotes.  Mutt does this for you, the
right way, as should any other program which interprets mailcap.  Don't
put them into backtick expansions.  Be highly careful with evil
statements, and avoid them if possible at all.  Trying to fix broken
behavior with quotes introduces new leaks &mdash; there is no
alternative to correct quoting in the first place.
</para>

<para>
If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you need
quoting or backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable and
reference the shell variable where necessary, as in the following
example (using <literal>$charset</literal> inside the backtick expansion
is safe, since it is not itself subject to any further expansion):
</para>

<screen>
text/test-mailcap-bug; cat %s; copiousoutput; test=charset=%{charset} \
        &amp;&amp; test "`echo $charset | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" != iso-8859-1
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="advanced-mailcap">
<title>Advanced Mailcap Usage</title>

<sect3 id="optional-mailcap-fields">
<title>Optional Fields</title>

<para>
In addition to the required content-type and view command fields, you
can add semi-colon <quote>;</quote> separated fields to set flags and
other options.  Mutt recognizes the following optional fields:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>copiousoutput</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This flag tells Mutt that the command passes possibly large amounts of
text on standard output.  This causes Mutt to invoke a pager (either
the internal pager or the external pager defined by the pager variable)
on the output of the view command.  Without this flag, Mutt assumes that
the command is interactive.  One could use this to replace the pipe to
<literal>more</literal> in the <literal>lynx -dump</literal> example in
the Basic section:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx -dump %s ; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
This will cause lynx to format the <literal>text/html</literal> output
as <literal>text/plain</literal> and Mutt will use your standard pager
to display the results.
</para>

<para>
Note that when using the built-in pager, <emphasis>only</emphasis>
entries with this flag will be considered a handler for a MIME type
&mdash; all other entries will be ignored.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>needsterminal</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt uses this flag when viewing attachments with <link
linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, in order to
decide whether it should honor the setting of the <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> variable or not.  When an attachment
is viewed using an interactive program, and the corresponding mailcap
entry has a <emphasis>needsterminal</emphasis> flag, Mutt will use <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> and the exit status of the program
to decide if it will ask you to press a key after the external program
has exited.  In all other situations it will not prompt you for a key.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>compose=&lt;command&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This flag specifies the command to use to create a new attachment of a
specific MIME type.  Mutt supports this from the compose menu.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>composetyped=&lt;command&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This flag specifies the command to use to create a new attachment of a
specific MIME type.  This command differs from the compose command in
that Mutt will expect standard MIME headers on the data.  This can be
used to specify parameters, filename, description, etc. for a new
attachment.  Mutt supports this from the compose menu.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>print=&lt;command&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This flag specifies the command to use to print a specific MIME type.
Mutt supports this from the attachment and compose menus.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>edit=&lt;command&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This flag specifies the command to use to edit a specific MIME type.
Mutt supports this from the compose menu, and also uses it to compose
new attachments.  Mutt will default to the defined <link
linkend="editor">$editor</link> for text attachments.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>nametemplate=&lt;template&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This field specifies the format for the file denoted by
<literal>%s</literal> in the command fields.  Certain programs will
require a certain file extension, for instance, to correctly view a
file.  For instance, lynx will only interpret a file as
<literal>text/html</literal> if the file ends in
<literal>.html</literal>.  So, you would specify lynx as a
<literal>text/html</literal> viewer with a line in the mailcap file
like:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
</screen>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>test=&lt;command&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This field specifies a command to run to test whether this mailcap entry
should be used.  The command is defined with the command expansion rules
defined in the next section.  If the command returns 0, then the test
passed, and Mutt uses this entry.  If the command returns non-zero, then
the test failed, and Mutt continues searching for the right entry.  Note
that the content-type must match before Mutt performs the test.  For
example:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; firefox -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html; lynx %s
</screen>

<para>
In this example, Mutt will run the program <literal>RunningX</literal>
which will return 0 if the X Window manager is running, and non-zero if
it isn't.  If <literal>RunningX</literal> returns 0, then Mutt will run
firefox to display the <literal>text/html</literal> object.  If RunningX
doesn't return 0, then Mutt will go on to the next entry and use lynx to
display the <literal>text/html</literal> object.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="mailcap-search-order">
<title>Search Order</title>

<para>
When searching for an entry in the mailcap file, Mutt will search for
the most useful entry for its purpose.  For instance, if you are
attempting to print an <literal>image/gif</literal>, and you have the
following entries in your mailcap file, Mutt will search for an entry
with the print command:
</para>

<screen>
image/*;        xv %s
image/gif;      ; print= anytopnm %s | pnmtops | lpr; \
                nametemplate=%s.gif
</screen>

<para>
Mutt will skip the <literal>image/*</literal> entry and use the
<literal>image/gif</literal> entry with the print command.
</para>

<para>
In addition, you can use this with <link
linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link> to denote two
commands for viewing an attachment, one to be viewed automatically, the
other to be viewed interactively from the attachment menu using the
<literal>&lt;view-mailcap&gt;</literal> function (bound to
<quote>m</quote> by default). In addition, you can then use the test
feature to determine which viewer to use interactively depending on your
environment.
</para>

<screen>
text/html;      firefox -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html;      lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
For <link linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, Mutt
will choose the third entry because of the
<literal>copiousoutput</literal> tag.  For interactive viewing, Mutt
will run the program <literal>RunningX</literal> to determine if it
should use the first entry.  If the program returns non-zero, Mutt will
use the second entry for interactive viewing. The last entry is for
inline display in the pager and the
<literal>&lt;view-attach&gt;</literal> function in the attachment menu.
</para>

<para>
Entries with the <literal>copiousoutput</literal> tag should always be
specified as the last one per type. For non-interactive use, the last
entry will then actually be the first matching one with the tag set.
For non-interactive use, only <literal>copiousoutput</literal>-tagged
entries are considered. For interactive use, Mutt ignores this tag and
treats all entries equally. Therefore, if not specified last, all
following entries without this tag would never be considered for
<literal>&lt;view-attach&gt;</literal> because the
<literal>copiousoutput</literal> before them matched already.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="mailcap-command-expansion">
<title>Command Expansion</title>

<para>
The various commands defined in the mailcap files are passed to the
<literal>/bin/sh</literal> shell using the <literal>system(3)</literal>
function.  Before the command is passed to <literal>/bin/sh
-c</literal>, it is parsed to expand various special parameters with
information from Mutt.  The keywords Mutt expands are:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>%s</term>
<listitem>
<para>
As seen in the basic mailcap section, this variable is expanded to a
filename specified by the calling program.  This file contains the body
of the message to view/print/edit or where the composing program should
place the results of composition.  In addition, the use of this keyword
causes Mutt to not pass the body of the message to the view/print/edit
program on stdin.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>%t</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt will expand <literal>%t</literal> to the text representation of the

the mailcap definition line, i.e. <literal>text/html</literal> or
<literal>image/gif</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>%{&lt;parameter&gt;}</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt will expand this to the value of the specified parameter from the
Content-Type: line of the mail message.  For instance, if your mail
message contains:
</para>

<screen>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
</screen>

<para>
then Mutt will expand <literal>%{charset}</literal> to
<quote>iso-8859-1</quote>.  The default metamail mailcap file uses this
feature to test the charset to spawn an xterm using the right charset to
view the message.

of these parameters is for multipart messages, which is handled

<para>
In addition to explicitly telling Mutt to view an attachment with the
MIME viewer defined in the mailcap file from the attachments menu, Mutt
has support for automatically viewing MIME attachments while in the
pager.
</para>

<para>
For this to work, you must define a viewer in the mailcap file which
uses the <literal>copiousoutput</literal> option to denote that it is
non-interactive.  Usually, you also use the entry to convert the
attachment to a text representation which you can view in the pager.
</para>

<para>
You then use the <command>auto_view</command> configuration command to
list the content-types that you wish to view automatically.  For
instance, if you set it to:
</para>

<screen>
auto_view text/html application/x-gunzip \
  application/postscript image/gif application/x-tar-gz
</screen>

<para>
...Mutt would try to find corresponding entries for rendering
attachments of these types as text. A corresponding mailcap could look
like:
</para>

<screen>
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
image/*;        anytopnm %s | pnmscale -xsize 80 -ysize 50 | ppmtopgm | \
                pgmtopbm | pbmtoascii ; copiousoutput
application/x-gunzip;   gzcat; copiousoutput
application/x-tar-gz; gunzip -c %s | tar -tf - ; copiousoutput
application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
<command>unauto_view</command> can be used to remove previous entries
from the <command>auto_view</command> list.  This can be used with <link
linkend="message-hook"><command>message-hook</command></link> to
autoview messages based on size, etc.
<quote><command>unauto_view</command> *</quote> will remove all previous
entries.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="alternative-order">
<title>MIME Multipart/Alternative</title>

<para>
The <literal>multipart/alternative</literal> container type only has
child MIME parts which represent the same content in an alternative
way. This is often used to send HTML messages which contain an
alternative plain text representation.
</para>

<para>
Mutt has some heuristics for determining which attachment of a
<literal>multipart/alternative</literal> type to display:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
First, Mutt will check the <command>alternative_order</command> list to
determine if one of the available types is preferred.  It consists of a
number of MIME types in order, including support for implicit and
explicit wildcards. For example:
</para>

<screen>
alternative_order text/enriched text/plain text \
  application/postscript image/*
</screen>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Next, Mutt will check if any of the types have a defined <link
linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, and use that.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Failing that, Mutt will look for any text type.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
As a last attempt, Mutt will look for any type it knows how to handle.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
To remove a MIME type from the <command>alternative_order</command>
list, use the <command>unalternative_order</command> command.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="attachments">
<title>Attachment Searching and Counting</title>

<para>
If you ever lose track of attachments in your mailboxes, Mutt's
attachment-counting and -searching support might be for you.  You can
make your message index display the number of qualifying attachments in
each message, or search for messages by attachment count.  You also can
configure what kinds of attachments qualify for this feature with the
<command>attachments</command> and <command>unattachments</command>
commands.
</para>

<para>
In order to provide this information, Mutt needs to fully MIME-parse all
messages affected first. This can slow down operation especially for
remote mail folders such as IMAP because all messages have to be
downloaded first regardless whether the user really wants to view them
or not though using <xref linkend="body-caching"/> usually means to
download the message just once.
</para>

<para>
The syntax is:
</para>

<cmdsynopsis>
<command>attachments</command>
<arg choice="plain">
<replaceable>{ + | - }disposition</replaceable>
</arg>
<arg choice="plain">
<replaceable>mime-type</replaceable>

</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
<emphasis>disposition</emphasis> is the attachment's Content-Disposition
type &mdash; either <literal>inline</literal> or
<literal>attachment</literal>.  You can abbreviate this to
<literal>I</literal> or <literal>A</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Disposition is prefixed by either a <quote>+</quote> symbol or a
<quote>-</quote> symbol.  If it's a <quote>+</quote>, you're saying that
you want to allow this disposition and MIME type to qualify.  If it's a
<quote>-</quote>, you're saying that this disposition and MIME type is
an exception to previous <quote>+</quote> rules.  There are examples
below of how this is useful.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>mime-type</emphasis> is the MIME type of the attachment you
want the command to affect.  A MIME type is always of the format
<literal>major/minor</literal>, where <literal>major</literal> describes
the broad category of document you're looking at, and
<literal>minor</literal> describes the specific type within that
category.  The major part of mime-type must be literal text (or the
special token <quote><literal>*</literal></quote>), but the minor part
may be a regular expression.  (Therefore,
<quote><literal>*/.*</literal></quote> matches any MIME type.)
</para>

<para>
The MIME types you give to the <command>attachments</command> directive
are a kind of pattern.  When you use the <command>attachments</command>
directive, the patterns you specify are added to a list.  When you use
<command>unattachments</command>, the pattern is removed from the list.
The patterns are not expanded and matched to specific MIME types at this
time &mdash; they're just text in a list.  They're only matched when
actually evaluating a message.
</para>

<para>
Some examples might help to illustrate.  The examples that are not
commented out define the default configuration of the lists.
</para>

MIME type is listed in <command>mime_lookup</command>, then the
extension of the filename will be compared to the list of extensions in
the <literal>mime.types</literal> file.  The MIME type associated with
this extension will then be used to process the attachment according to
the rules in the mailcap file and according to any other configuration
options (such as <command>auto_view</command>) specified.  Common usage
would be:
</para>

<title>Enabling/Disabling Features</title>

<para>
Mutt supports several of optional features which can be enabled or

script certain arguments. These are listed in the <quote>Optional
features</quote> section of the <emphasis>configure --help</emphasis>
output.
</para>

<para>
Which features are enabled or disabled can later be determined from the
output of <literal>mutt -v</literal>. If a compile option starts with

</sect2>

<sect2 id="url-syntax">
<title>URL Syntax</title>

<para>
Mutt optionally supports the IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols which require
to access servers using URLs. The canonical syntax for specifying URLs
in Mutt is (an item enclosed in <literal>[]</literal> means it is
optional and may be omitted):
</para>

<screen>
proto[s]://[username[:password]@]server[:port][/path]
</screen>

<para>
<emphasis>proto</emphasis> is the communication protocol:
<literal>imap</literal> for IMAP, <literal>pop</literal> for POP3 and
<literal>smtp</literal> for SMTP. If <quote>s</quote> for <quote>secure
communication</quote> is appended, Mutt will attempt to establish an
encrypted communication using SSL or TLS.
</para>

<para>
Since all protocols supported by Mutt support/require authentication,
login credentials may be specified in the URL. This has the advantage
that multiple IMAP, POP3 or SMTP servers may be specified (which isn't
possible using, for example, <link
linkend="imap-user">$imap_user</link>). The username may contain the
<quote>@</quote> symbol being used by many mail systems as part of the
login name. The special characters <quote>/</quote>
(<literal>%2F</literal>), <quote>:</quote> (<literal>%3A</literal>) and
<quote>%</quote> (<literal>%25</literal>) have to be URL-encoded in
usernames using the <literal>%</literal>-notation.
</para>

<para>
A password can be given, too but is not recommended if the URL is
specified in a configuration file on disk.
</para>

<para>
If no port number is given, Mutt will use the system's default for the
given protocol (usually consulting <literal>/etc/services</literal>).
</para>

The optional path is only relevant for IMAP and ignored elsewhere.

<sect1 id="ssl">
<title>SSL/TLS Support</title>

<para>
If Mutt is compiled with IMAP, POP3 and/or SMTP support, it can also be
compiled with support for SSL or TLS using either OpenSSL or GnuTLS ( by
running the <emphasis>configure</emphasis> script with the
<emphasis>--enable-ssl=...</emphasis> option for OpenSSL or
<emphasis>--enable-gnutls=...</emphasis> for GnuTLS). Mutt can then
attempt to encrypt communication with remote servers if these protocols
are suffixed with <quote>s</quote> for <quote>secure
communication</quote>.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="pop">
<title>POP3 Support</title>

<para>
If Mutt is compiled with POP3 support (by running the
<emphasis>configure</emphasis> script with the
<emphasis>--enable-pop</emphasis> flag), it has the ability to work with
mailboxes located on a remote POP3 server and fetch mail for local
browsing.
</para>

<para>
Remote POP3 servers can be accessed using URLs with the
<literal>pop</literal> protocol for unencrypted and
<literal>pops</literal> for encrypted communication, see <xref
linkend="url-syntax"/> for details.
</para>

<para>
Polling for new mail is more expensive over POP3 than locally. For this
reason the frequency at which Mutt will check for mail remotely can be
controlled by the <link
linkend="pop-checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</link> variable, which
defaults to every 60 seconds.
</para>

<para>
POP is read-only which doesn't allow for some features like editing
messages or changing flags. However, using <xref
linkend="header-caching"/> and <xref linkend="body-caching"/> Mutt
simulates the new/old/read flags as well as flagged and replied.  Mutt
applies some logic on top of remote messages but cannot change them so
that modifications of flags are lost when messages are downloaded from
the POP server (either by Mutt or other tools).
</para>

<anchor id="fetch-mail"/>
<para>
Another way to access your POP3 mail is the
<literal>&lt;fetch-mail&gt;</literal> function (default: G).  It allows
to connect to <link linkend="pop-host">$pop_host</link>, fetch all your
new mail and place it in the local <link
linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link>.  After this point, Mutt runs
exactly as if the mail had always been local.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you only need to fetch all messages to a local mailbox you should
consider using a specialized program, such as
<literal>fetchmail(1)</literal>, <literal>getmail(1)</literal> or
similar.

<sect1 id="imap">
<title>IMAP Support</title>

<para>
If Mutt was compiled with IMAP support (by running the
<emphasis>configure</emphasis> script with the
<emphasis>--enable-imap</emphasis> flag), it has the ability to work
with folders located on a remote IMAP server.
</para>

<para>
You can access the remote inbox by selecting the folder by its URL (see
<xref linkend="url-syntax"/> for details) using the
<literal>imap</literal> or <literal>imaps</literal> protocol.
Alternatively, a pine-compatible notation is also supported, i.e.
<literal>{[username@]imapserver[:port][/ssl]}path/to/folder</literal>
</para>

<para>
Note that not all servers use <quote>/</quote> as the hierarchy
separator.  Mutt should correctly notice which separator is being used
by the server and convert paths accordingly.
</para>

<para>
When browsing folders on an IMAP server, you can toggle whether to look
at only the folders you are subscribed to, or all folders with the
<emphasis>toggle-subscribed</emphasis> command.  See also the <link
linkend="imap-list-subscribed">$imap_list_subscribed</link> variable.
</para>

<para>
Polling for new mail on an IMAP server can cause noticeable delays. So,
you'll want to carefully tune the <link
linkend="mail-check">$mail_check</link> and <link
linkend="timeout">$timeout</link> variables. Reasonable values are:
</para>

<screen>
set mail_check=90
set timeout=15

<para>
with relatively good results even over slow modem lines.
</para>

<note>
<para>

<sect2 id="imap-authentication">
<title>Authentication</title>

<para>
Mutt supports four authentication methods with IMAP servers: SASL,
GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, and LOGIN (there is a patch by Grant Edwards to add
NTLM authentication for you poor exchange users out there, but it has
yet to be integrated into the main tree). There is also support for the
pseudo-protocol ANONYMOUS, which allows you to log in to a public IMAP
server without having an account. To use ANONYMOUS, simply make your
username blank or <quote>anonymous</quote>.
</para>

<para>
SASL is a special super-authenticator, which selects among several
protocols (including GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, and DIGEST-MD5) the
most secure method available on your host and the server. Using some of
these methods (including DIGEST-MD5 and possibly GSSAPI), your entire
session will be encrypted and invisible to those teeming network
snoops. It is the best option if you have it. To use it, you must have
the Cyrus SASL library installed on your system and compile Mutt with
the <emphasis>--with-sasl</emphasis> flag.
</para>

<para>
Mutt will try whichever methods are compiled in and available on the
server, in the following order: SASL, ANONYMOUS, GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5,
LOGIN.
</para>

<para>
There are a few variables which control authentication:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
<link linkend="imap-user">$imap_user</link> - controls the username
under which you request authentication on the IMAP server, for all
authenticators. This is overridden by an explicit username in the
mailbox path (i.e. by using a mailbox name of the form
<literal>{user@host}</literal>).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<link linkend="imap-pass">$imap_pass</link> - a password which you may
preset, used by all authentication methods where a password is needed.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<link linkend="imap-authenticators">$imap_authenticators</link> - a
colon-delimited list of IMAP authentication methods to try, in the order
you wish to try them. If specified, this overrides Mutt's default

</para>

<para>
If the configuration variable <link linkend="smtp-url">$smtp_url</link>

If you happen to have accounts on multiple IMAP, POP and/or SMTP

inconvenient and error-prone. The <link
linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link> command
may help. This hook works like <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command></link> but is
invoked whenever Mutt needs to access a remote mailbox (including inside
the folder browser), not just when you open the mailbox. This includes
(for example) polling for new mail, storing Fcc messages and saving
messages to a folder. As a consequence, <link
linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link> should
only be used to set connection-related settings such as passwords or
tunnel commands but not settings such as sender address or name (because
in general it should be considered unpredictable which <link

used).
</para>

</example>

<para>
In example <xref linkend="ex-multiaccount"/> the folders are defined
using <link linkend="mailboxes"><command>mailboxes</command></link> so
Mutt polls them for new mail. Each <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command></link> triggers
when one mailbox below each IMAP account is opened and sets <link
linkend="folder">$folder</link> to the account's root folder. Next, it
sets <link linkend="record">$record</link> to the
<emphasis>INBOX/Sent</emphasis> folder below the newly set <link
linkend="folder">$folder</link>. Please notice that the value the
<quote>+</quote> <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox shortcut</link>
refers to depends on the <emphasis>current</emphasis> value of <link
linkend="folder">$folder</link> and therefore has to be set separately
per account. Setting other values like <link linkend="from">$from</link>
or <link linkend="signature">$signature</link> is analogous to setting
<link linkend="record">$record</link>.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="caching">
<title>Local Caching</title>

<para>
Mutt contains two types of local caching: <emphasis>(1)</emphasis> the
so-called <quote>header caching</quote> and <emphasis>(2)</emphasis> the
so-called <quote>body caching</quote> which are both described in this
section.
</para>

<para>
Header caching is optional as it depends on external libraries, body
caching is always enabled if Mutt is compiled with POP and/or IMAP
support as these use it (body caching requires no external library).
</para>

<sect2 id="header-caching">
<title>Header Caching</title>

<para>
Mutt provides optional support for caching message headers for the
following types of folders: IMAP, POP, Maildir and MH. Header caching
greatly speeds up opening large folders because for remote folders,
headers usually only need to be downloaded once. For Maildir and MH,
reading the headers from a single file is much faster than looking at
possibly thousands of single files (since Maildir and MH use one file
per message.)
</para>

<para>
Header caching can be enabled via the configure script and the
<emphasis>--enable-hcache</emphasis> option. It's not turned on by
default because external database libraries are required: one of
tokyocabinet, qdbm, gdbm or bdb must be present.
</para>

<para>
If enabled, <link linkend="header-cache">$header_cache</link> can be
used to either point to a file or a directory. If set to point to a
file, one database file for all folders will be used (which may result
in lower performance), but one file per folder if it points to a
directory.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="body-caching">
<title>Body Caching</title>

<para>
Both cache methods can be combined using the same directory for storage
(and for IMAP/POP even provide meaningful file names) which simplifies
manual maintenance tasks.
</para>

<para>
In addition to caching message headers only, Mutt can also cache whole
message bodies. This results in faster display of messages for POP and
IMAP folders because messages usually have to be downloaded only once.
</para>

<para>
For configuration, the variable <link linkend="message-cachedir"
>$message_cachedir</link> must point to a directory. There, Mutt will
create a hierarchy of subdirectories named like the account and mailbox
path the cache is for.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="cache-dirs">
<title>Cache Directories</title>

<para>
For using both, header and body caching, <link
linkend="header-cache">$header_cache</link> and <link
linkend="message-cachedir" >$message_cachedir</link> can be safely set
to the same value.
</para>

<para>
In a header or body cache directory, Mutt creates a directory hierarchy
named like: <literal>proto:user@hostname</literal> where
<literal>proto</literal> is either <quote>pop</quote> or
<quote>imap.</quote> Within there, for each folder, Mutt stores messages
in single files and header caches in files with the
<quote>.hcache</quote> extension.  All files can be removed as needed if
the consumed disk space becomes an issue as Mutt will silently fetch
missing items again. Pathnames are always stored in UTF-8 encoding.
</para>

<para>
For Maildir and MH, the header cache files are named after the MD5
checksum of the path.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="maint-cache">
<title>Maintenance</title>

<para>
Mutt does not (yet) support maintenance features for header cache
database files so that files have to be removed in case they grow too
big. It depends on the database library used for header caching whether
disk space freed by removing messages is re-used.
</para>

<para>
For body caches, Mutt can keep the local cache in sync with the remote
mailbox if the <link
linkend="message-cache-clean">$message_cache_clean</link> variable is
set. Cleaning means to remove messages from the cache which are no
longer present in the mailbox which only happens when other mail clients
or instances of Mutt using a different body cache location delete
messages (Mutt itself removes deleted messages from the cache when
syncing a mailbox). As cleaning can take a noticeable amount of time, it
should not be set in general but only occasionally.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="exact-address">
<title>Exact Address Generation</title>

<para>
Mutt supports the <quote>Name &lt;user@host&gt;</quote> address syntax
for reading and writing messages, the older <quote>user@host
(Name)</quote> syntax is only supported when reading messages. The
<emphasis>--enable-exact-address</emphasis> switch can be given to
configure to build it with write-support for the latter
syntax. <literal>EXACT_ADDRESS</literal> in the output of <literal>mutt
-v</literal> indicates whether it's supported.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="sending-mixmaster">
<title>Sending Anonymous Messages via Mixmaster</title>

<para>
You may also have compiled Mutt to co-operate with Mixmaster, an
anonymous remailer.  Mixmaster permits you to send your messages
anonymously using a chain of remailers. Mixmaster support in Mutt is for
mixmaster version 2.04 or later.
</para>

<para>
To use it, you'll have to obey certain restrictions.  Most important,
you cannot use the <literal>Cc</literal> and <literal>Bcc</literal>
headers.  To tell Mutt to use mixmaster, you have to select a remailer
chain, using the mix function on the compose menu.
</para>

<para>
The chain selection screen is divided into two parts.  In the (larger)
upper part, you get a list of remailers you may use.  In the lower part,
you see the currently selected chain of remailers.
</para>

<para>
You can navigate in the chain using the
<literal>&lt;chain-prev&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;chain-next&gt;</literal> functions, which are by default
bound to the left and right arrows and to the <literal>h</literal> and
<literal>l</literal> keys (think vi keyboard bindings).  To insert a
remailer at the current chain position, use the
<literal>&lt;insert&gt;</literal> function.  To append a remailer behind
the current chain position, use <literal>&lt;select-entry&gt;</literal>
or <literal>&lt;append&gt;</literal>.  You can also delete entries from
the chain, using the corresponding function.  Finally, to abandon your
changes, leave the menu, or <literal>&lt;accept&gt;</literal> them
pressing (by default) the <literal>Return</literal> key.
</para>

<para>
Note that different remailers do have different capabilities, indicated
in the %c entry of the remailer menu lines (see <link
linkend="mix-entry-format">$mix_entry_format</link>).  Most important is
the <quote>middleman</quote> capability, indicated by a capital
<quote>M</quote>: This means that the remailer in question cannot be
used as the final element of a chain, but will only forward messages to
other mixmaster remailers.  For details on the other capabilities,
please have a look at the mixmaster documentation.

<chapter id="security">
<title>Security Considerations</title>

<para>
First of all, Mutt contains no security holes included by intention but
may contain unknown security holes. As a consequence, please run Mutt
only with as few permissions as possible. Especially, do not run Mutt as
the super user.
</para>

<para>
When configuring Mutt, there're some points to note about secure setups
so please read this chapter carefully.
</para>

<sect1 id="security-passwords">
<title>Passwords</title>

<para>
Although Mutt can be told the various passwords for accounts, please
never store passwords in configuration files. Besides the fact that the
system's operator can always read them, you could forget to mask it out
when reporting a bug or asking for help via a mailing list. Even worse,
your mail including your password could be archived by internet search
engines, mail-to-news gateways etc. It may already be too late before
you notice your mistake.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-tempfiles">
<title>Temporary Files</title>

<para>
Mutt uses many temporary files for viewing messages, verifying digital
signatures, etc. As long as being used, these files are visible by other
users and maybe even readable in case of misconfiguration.  Also, a
different location for these files may be desired which can be changed
via the <link linkend="tmpdir">$tmpdir</link> variable.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-leaks">
<title>Information Leaks</title>

<sect2 id="security-leaks-mid">
<title>Message-Id: headers</title>

<para>
Message-Id: headers contain a local part that is to be created in a
unique fashion. In order to do so, Mutt will <quote>leak</quote> some
information to the outside world when sending messages: the generation
of this header includes a step counter which is increased (and rotated)
with every message sent. In a longer running mutt session, others can
make assumptions about your mailing habits depending on the number of
messages sent. If this is not desired, the header can be manually
provided using <link linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link> (though
not recommended).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="security-leaks-mailto">
<title><literal>mailto:</literal>-style Links</title>

<para>
As Mutt be can be set up to be the mail client to handle
<literal>mailto:</literal> style links in websites, there're security
considerations, too. Arbitrary header fields can be embedded in these
links which could override existing header fields or attach arbitrary
files using <link linkend="attach-header">the Attach:
pseudoheader</link>. This may be problematic if the <link
linkend="edit-headers">$edit-headers</link> variable is
<emphasis>unset</emphasis>, i.e. the user doesn't want to see header
fields while editing the message and doesn't pay enough attention to the
compose menu's listing of attachments.
</para>

<para>
For example, following a link like
</para>

<screen>
mailto:joe@host?Attach=~/.gnupg/secring.gpg</screen>

<para>
will send out the user's private gnupg keyring to
<literal>joe@host</literal> if the user doesn't follow the information
on screen carefully enough.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-external">
<title>External Applications</title>

<para>
Mutt in many places has to rely on external applications or for
convenience supports mechanisms involving external applications.
</para>

<para>
One of these is the <literal>mailcap</literal> mechanism as defined by
RfC1524. Details about a secure use of the mailcap mechanisms is given
in <xref linkend="secure-mailcap"/>.
</para>

<para>
Besides the mailcap mechanism, Mutt uses a number of other external
utilities for operation, for example to provide crypto support, in
backtick expansion in configuration files or format string filters.  The
same security considerations apply for these as for tools involved via
mailcap.

<chapter id="tuning">
<title>Performance Tuning</title>

<sect1 id="tuning-mailboxes">
<title>Reading and Writing Mailboxes</title>

<para>
Mutt's performance when reading mailboxes can be improved in two ways:
</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
For remote folders (IMAP and POP) as well as folders using one-file-per
message storage (Maildir and MH), Mutt's performance can be greatly
improved using <link linkend="header-caching">header caching</link>.
using a single database per folder.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Mutt provides the <link linkend="read-inc">$read_inc</link> and <link
linkend="write-inc">$write_inc</link> variables to specify at which rate
to update progress counters. If these values are too low, Mutt may spend
more time on updating the progress counter than it spends on actually
reading/writing folders.
</para>

<para>
For example, when opening a maildir folder with a few thousand messages,
the default value for <link linkend="read-inc">$read_inc</link> may be
too low. It can be tuned on on a folder-basis using <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command>s</link>:
</para>

<screen>
<emphasis role="comment"># use very high $read_inc to speed up reading hcache'd maildirs</emphasis>
folder-hook . 'set read_inc=1000'
<emphasis role="comment"># use lower value for reading slower remote IMAP folders</emphasis>
folder-hook ^imap 'set read_inc=100'
<emphasis role="comment"># use even lower value for reading even slower remote POP folders</emphasis>
folder-hook ^pop 'set read_inc=1'</screen>

</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
These settings work on a per-message basis. However, as messages may
greatly differ in size and certain operations are much faster than
others, even per-folder settings of the increment variables may not be
desirable as they produce either too few or too much progress updates.
Thus, Mutt allows to limit the number of progress updates per second
it'll actually send to the terminal using the <link
linkend="time-inc">$time_inc</link> variable.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="tuning-messages">
<title>Reading Messages from Remote Folders</title>

<para>
Reading messages from remote folders such as IMAP an POP can be slow
especially for large mailboxes since Mutt only caches a very limited
number of recently viewed messages (usually 10) per session (so that it
will be gone for the next session.)
</para>

<para>
To improve performance and permanently cache whole messages, please
refer to Mutt's so-called <link linkend="body-caching">body
caching</link> for details.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="tuning-search">
<title>Searching and Limiting</title>

<para>
When searching mailboxes either via a search or a limit action, for some
patterns Mutt distinguishes between regular expression and string
searches. For regular expressions, patterns are prefixed with
<quote>~</quote> and with <quote>=</quote> for string searches.
</para>

<para>
Even though a regular expression search is fast, it's several times
slower than a pure string search which is noticeable especially on large
folders. As a consequence, a string search should be used instead of a
regular expression search if the user already knows enough about the
search pattern.
</para>

<para>
For example, when limiting a large folder to all messages sent to or by
an author, it's much faster to search for the initial part of an e-mail
address via <literal>=Luser@</literal> instead of
<literal>~Luser@</literal>. This is especially true for searching
message bodies since a larger amount of input has to be searched.
</para>

<para>
As for regular expressions, a lower case string search pattern makes
Mutt perform a case-insensitive search except for IMAP (because for IMAP
Mutt performs server-side searches which don't support
case-insensitivity).
</para>

<title>Configuration Variables</title>

<sect2 id="abort-nosubject">
<title>abort_nosubject</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</literallayout>

<para>
If set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, when composing messages and no subject is given
at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to
<emphasis>no</emphasis>, composing messages with no subject given at the subject
prompt will never be aborted.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="abort-unmodified">
<title>abort_unmodified</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, composition will automatically abort after
editing the message body if no changes are made to the file (this
check only happens after the <emphasis>first</emphasis> edit of the file).  When set
to <emphasis>no</emphasis>, composition will never be aborted.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="alias-file">
<title>alias_file</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>~/.muttrc</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
The default file in which to save aliases created by the
<literal><link linkend="create-alias">&lt;create-alias&gt;</link></literal> function. Entries added to this file are
encoded in the character set specified by <link linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> if it
is <emphasis>set</emphasis> or the current character set otherwise.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> Mutt will not automatically source this file; you must
explicitly use the <quote><link linkend="source">source</link></quote> command for it to be executed in case
this option points to a dedicated alias file.
</para>
<para>
The default for this option is the currently used muttrc file, or
<quote>~/.muttrc</quote> if no user muttrc was found.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="alias-format">
<title>alias_format</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the format of the data displayed for the <quote><link linkend="alias">alias</link></quote> menu.  The
following <literal>printf(3)</literal>-style sequences are available:

</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols="2">
<tbody>
<row><entry>%a </entry><entry>alias name
</entry></row>
<row><entry>%f </entry><entry>flags - currently, a <quote>d</quote> for an alias marked for deletion
</entry></row>
<row><entry>%n </entry><entry>index number
</entry></row>
<row><entry>%r </entry><entry>address which alias expands to
</entry></row>
<row><entry>%t </entry><entry>character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion
</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></informaltable>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="allow-8bit">
<title>allow_8bit</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either Quoted-
Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="allow-ansi">
<title>allow_ansi</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in
rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is <emphasis>set</emphasis>,
their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
message could include a line like

</para>

<screen>
[-- PGP output follows ...
</screen><para>
and give it the same color as your attachment color (see also
<link linkend="crypt-timestamp">$crypt_timestamp</link>).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="arrow-cursor">
<title>arrow_cursor</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, an arrow (<quote>-&gt;</quote>) will be used to indicate the current entry
in menus instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
in the menu.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ascii-chars">
<title>ascii_chars</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
and attachment trees, instead of the default <emphasis>ACS</emphasis> characters.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="askbcc">
<title>askbcc</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients
before editing an outgoing message.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="askcc">
<title>askcc</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will prompt you for carbon-copy (Cc) recipients before
editing the body of an outgoing message.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="assumed-charset">
<title>assumed_charset</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
schemes for messages without character encoding indication.
Header field values and message body content without character encoding
indication would be assumed that they are written in one of this list.
By default, all the header fields and message body without any charset
indication are assumed to be in <quote>us-ascii</quote>.
</para>
<para>
For example, Japanese users might prefer this:

</para>

<screen>
set assumed_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
</screen><para>
However, only the first content is valid for the message body.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="attach-charset">
<title>attach_charset</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
schemes for text file attachments. Mutt uses this setting to guess
which encoding files being attached are encoded in to convert them to
a proper character set given in <link linkend="send-charset">$send_charset</link>.
</para>
<para>
If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, the value of <link linkend="charset">$charset</link> will be used instead.
For example, the following configuration would work for Japanese
text handling:

</para>

<screen>
set attach_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
</screen><para>
Note: for Japanese users, <quote>iso-2022-*</quote> must be put at the head
of the value as shown above if included.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="attach-format">
<title>attach_format</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%&gt; [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] </literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable describes the format of the <quote>attachment</quote> menu.  The
following <literal>printf(3)</literal>-style sequences are understood:

</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols="2">
<tbody>
<row><entry>%C  </entry><entry>charset

</entry></row>
<row><entry>%|X </entry><entry>pad to the end of the line with character <quote>X</quote>
</entry></row>
<row><entry>%*X </entry><entry>soft-fill with character <quote>X</quote> as pad
</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

<para>
For an explanation of <quote>soft-fill</quote>, see the <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> documentation.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="attach-sep">
<title>attach_sep</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>\n</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="attach-split">
<title>attach_split</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If this variable is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt will concatenate the
attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
<link linkend="attach-sep">$attach_sep</link> separator is added after each attachment. When <emphasis>set</emphasis>,
Mutt will operate on the attachments one by one.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="attribution">
<title>attribution</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>On %d, %n wrote:</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
in a reply.  For a full listing of defined <literal>printf(3)</literal>-like sequences see
the section on <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="auto-tag">
<title>auto_tag</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, functions in the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu which affect a message
will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
unset, you must first use the <literal>&lt;tag-prefix&gt;</literal> function (bound to <quote>;</quote>
by default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="autoedit">
<title>autoedit</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis> along with <link linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link>, Mutt will skip the initial
send-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and allow you to
immediately begin editing the body of your
message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
editing the body of your message.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> when this option is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, you cannot use send-hooks that depend
on the recipients when composing a new (non-reply) message, as the initial
list of recipients is empty.
</para>
<para>
Also see <link linkend="fast-reply">$fast_reply</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="beep">
<title>beep</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will beep when an error occurs.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="beep-new">
<title>beep_new</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will beep whenever it prints a message
notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
<link linkend="beep">$beep</link> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="bounce">
<title>bounce</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
If set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
message. Setting this variable to <emphasis>no</emphasis> is not generally useful,
and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="bounce-delivered">
<title>bounce_delivered</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will include Delivered-To headers when
bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to <emphasis>unset</emphasis> this variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="braille-friendly">
<title>braille_friendly</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will place the cursor at the beginning
of the current line in menus, even when the <link linkend="arrow-cursor">$arrow_cursor</link> variable
is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, making it easier for blind persons using Braille displays to
follow these menus.  The option is <emphasis>unset</emphasis> by default because many
visual terminals don't permit making the cursor invisible.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="certificate-file">
<title>certificate_file</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>~/.mutt_certificates</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust
are saved. When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked
if you accept it or not. If you accept it, the certificate can also
be saved in this file and further connections are automatically
accepted.
</para>
<para>
You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
certificate that is signed with one of these CA certificates is
also automatically accepted.
</para>
<para>
Example:

</para>

<screen>
set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates
</screen></sect2>

<sect2 id="charset">
<title>charset</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Character set your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.
It is also the fallback for <link linkend="send-charset">$send_charset</link>.
</para>
<para>
Upon startup Mutt tries to derive this value from environment variables
such as <literal>$LC_CTYPE</literal> or <literal>$LANG</literal>.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> It should only be set in case Mutt isn't able to determine the
character set used correctly.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="check-mbox-size">
<title>check_mbox_size</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will use file size attribute instead of
access time when checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf folders.
</para>
<para>
This variable is <emphasis>unset</emphasis> by default and should only be enabled when
new mail detection for these folder types is unreliable or doesn't work.
</para>
<para>
Note that enabling this variable should happen before any <quote><link linkend="mailboxes">mailboxes</link></quote>
directives occur in configuration files regarding mbox or mmdf folders
because mutt needs to determine the initial new mail status of such a
mailbox by performing a fast mailbox scan when it is defined.
Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size changes.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="check-new">
<title>check_new</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> this option only affects <emphasis>maildir</emphasis> and <emphasis>MH</emphasis> style
mailboxes.
</para>
<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while the
mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
this variable is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, no check for new mail is performed
while the mailbox is open.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="collapse-unread">
<title>collapse_unread</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
unread messages.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="compose-format">
<title>compose_format</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%&gt;-</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Controls the format of the status line displayed in the <quote>compose</quote>
menu.  This string is similar to <link linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>, but has its own
set of <literal>printf(3)</literal>-like sequences:

</para>

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="config-charset">
<title>config_charset</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
When defined, Mutt will recode commands in rc files from this
encoding to the current character set as specified by <link linkend="charset">$charset</link>
and aliases written to <link linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link> from the current character set.
</para>
<para>
Please note that if setting <link linkend="charset">$charset</link> it must be done before
setting <link linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link>.
</para>
<para>
Recoding should be avoided as it may render unconvertable
characters as question marks which can lead to undesired
side effects (for example in regular expressions).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="confirmappend">
<title>confirmappend</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean

an existing mailbox.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="confirmcreate">
<title>confirmcreate</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a
mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="connect-timeout">
<title>connect_timeout</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 30</literallayout>

<para>
Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP, POP or SMTP) after this
many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
value causes Mutt to wait indefinitely for the connection attempt to succeed.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="content-type">
<title>content_type</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>text/plain</literal></quote></literallayout>

Sets the default Content-Type for the body of newly composed messages.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="copy">
<title>copy</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages
will be saved for later references.  Also see <link linkend="record">$record</link>,
<link linkend="save-name">$save_name</link>, <link linkend="force-name">$force_name</link> and <quote><link linkend="fcc-hook">fcc-hook</link></quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="crypt-autoencrypt">
<title>crypt_autoencrypt</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP
encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in
connection to the <quote><link linkend="send-hook">send-hook</link></quote> command.  It can be overridden
by use of the pgp menu, when encryption is not required or
signing is requested as well.  If <link linkend="smime-is-default">$smime_is_default</link> is <emphasis>set</emphasis>,
then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and
settings can be overridden by use of the smime menu instead.

<sect2 id="crypt-autosign">
<title>crypt_autosign</title>

Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to
cryptographically sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden
by use of the pgp menu, when signing is not required or
encryption is requested as well. If <link linkend="smime-is-default">$smime_is_default</link> is <emphasis>set</emphasis>,

<title>crypt_replysignencrypted</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages
which are encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
<link linkend="crypt-replyencrypt">$crypt_replyencrypt</link>, because it allows you to sign all
messages which are automatically encrypted.  This works around
the problem noted in <link linkend="crypt-replysign">$crypt_replysign</link>, that mutt is not able
to find out whether an encrypted message is also signed.
(Crypto only)
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="crypt-timestamp">
<title>crypt_timestamp</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will include a time stamp in the lines surrounding
PGP or S/MIME output, so spoofing such lines is more difficult.
If you are using colors to mark these lines, and rely on these,
you may <emphasis>unset</emphasis> this setting.
(Crypto only)
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="crypt-use-gpgme">
<title>crypt_use_gpgme</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls the use of the GPGME-enabled crypto backends.
If it is <emphasis>set</emphasis> and Mutt was built with gpgme support, the gpgme code for
S/MIME and PGP will be used instead of the classic code.  Note that
you need to set this option in .muttrc; it won't have any effect when
used interactively.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="crypt-use-pka">
<title>crypt_use_pka</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls the format of the date printed by the <quote>%d</quote>
sequence in <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>.  This is passed to the <literal>strftime(3)</literal>
function to process the date, see the man page for the proper syntax.
</para>
<para>
Unless the first character in the string is a bang (<quote>!</quote>), the month
and week day names are expanded according to the locale specified in
the variable <link linkend="locale">$locale</link>. If the first character in the string is a
bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
rest of the string are expanded in the <emphasis>C</emphasis> locale (that is in US
English).

This variable controls how <quote><link linkend="message-hook">message-hook</link></quote>, <quote><link linkend="reply-hook">reply-hook</link></quote>, <quote><link linkend="send-hook">send-hook</link></quote>,
<quote><link linkend="send2-hook">send2-hook</link></quote>, <quote><link linkend="save-hook">save-hook</link></quote>, and <quote><link linkend="fcc-hook">fcc-hook</link></quote> will
be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp,
instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
variable at the time the hook is declared.
</para>
<para>
The default value matches
if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
<quote><link linkend="alternates">alternates</link></quote>) and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
regular expression.

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="delete-untag">
<title>delete_untag</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="digest-collapse">
<title>digest_collapse</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="encode-from">
<title>encode_from</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages when
they contain the string <quote>From </quote> (note the trailing space) in the beginning of a line.
This is useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
agents tend to do with messages (in order to prevent tools from
misinterpreting the line as a mbox message separator).

<sect2 id="followup-to">
<title>followup_to</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether or not the <quote>Mail-Followup-To:</quote> header field is
generated when sending mail.  When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will generate this
field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
the <quote><link linkend="subscribe">subscribe</link></quote> or <quote><link linkend="lists">lists</link></quote> commands.
</para>
<para>
This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from
receiving duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send
to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply
separately for any messages sent to known lists to which you are
not subscribed.
</para>
<para>
The header will contain only the list's address
for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own
email address for unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a
group reply to your message sent to a subscribed list will be
sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two copies
of the same email for you.
</para>

This variable is similar to <link linkend="save-name">$save_name</link>, except that Mutt will
store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.
</para>
<para>
Also see the <link linkend="record">$record</link> variable.
</para>

<sect2 id="forward-decode">
<title>forward_decode</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into <literal>text/plain</literal> when
forwarding a message.  The message header is also RFC2047 decoded.
This variable is only used, if <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>,
otherwise <link linkend="mime-forward-decode">$mime_forward_decode</link> is used instead.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="forward-decrypt">
<title>forward_decrypt</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls the handling of encrypted messages when forwarding a message.
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the outer layer of encryption is stripped off.  This
variable is only used if <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is <emphasis>set</emphasis> and
<link linkend="mime-forward-decode">$mime_forward_decode</link> is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>.
(PGP only)
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="forward-edit">
<title>forward_edit</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This quadoption controls whether or not the user is automatically
placed in the editor when forwarding messages.  For those who always want
to forward with no modification, use a setting of <quote>no</quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="forward-format">
<title>forward_format</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>[%a: %s]</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
It uses the same format sequences as the <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="forward-quote">
<title>forward_quote</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, forwarded messages included in the main body of the
message (when <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>) will be quoted using
<link linkend="indent-string">$indent_string</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="from">
<title>from</title>
<literallayout>Type: e-mail address
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, this variable contains a default from address.  It
can be overridden using <quote><link linkend="my-hdr">my_hdr</link></quote> (including from a <quote><link linkend="send-hook">send-hook</link></quote>) and
<link linkend="reverse-name">$reverse_name</link>.  This variable is ignored if <link linkend="use-from">$use_from</link> is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
This setting defaults to the contents of the environment variable <literal>$EMAIL</literal>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gecos-mask">
<title>gecos_mask</title>
<literallayout>Type: regular expression
Default: <quote><literal>^[^,]*</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
entry when expanding the alias.  The default value
will return the string up to the first <quote>,</quote> encountered.
If the GECOS field contains a string like <quote>lastname, firstname</quote> then you
should set it to <quote><literal>.*</literal></quote>.
</para>
<para>
This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address an e-mail
to user ID <quote>stevef</quote> whose full name is <quote>Steve Franklin</quote>.  If mutt expands
<quote>stevef</quote> to <quote>"Franklin" stevef@foo.bar</quote> then you should set the <link linkend="gecos-mask">$gecos_mask</link> to
a regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt will expand
<quote>Franklin</quote> to <quote>Franklin, Steve</quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hdrs">
<title>hdrs</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, the header fields normally added by the <quote><link linkend="my-hdr">my_hdr</link></quote>
command are not created.  This variable <emphasis>must</emphasis> be unset before
composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If <emphasis>set</emphasis>,
the user defined header fields are added to every new message.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="header">
<title>header</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, this variable causes Mutt to include the header
of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
The <link linkend="weed">$weed</link> setting applies.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="header-cache">
<title>header_cache</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This variable points to the header cache database.
If pointing to a directory Mutt will contain a header cache
database file per folder, if pointing to a file that file will
be a single global header cache. By default it is <emphasis>unset</emphasis> so no header
caching will be used.
</para>
<para>
Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening POP, IMAP
MH or Maildir folders, see <quote><link linkend="caching">caching</link></quote> for details.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="header-cache-compress">
<title>header_cache_compress</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When mutt is compiled with qdbm or tokyocabinet as header cache backend,
this option determines whether the database will be compressed.
Compression results in database files roughly being one fifth
of the usual diskspace, but the decompression can result in a
slower opening of cached folder(s) which in general is still
much faster than opening non header cached folders.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="header-cache-pagesize">
<title>header_cache_pagesize</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>16384</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
When mutt is compiled with either gdbm or bdb4 as the header cache backend,
this option changes the database page size.  Too large or too small
values can waste space, memory, or CPU time. The default should be more
or less optimal for most use cases.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="help">
<title>help</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is
running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
of these should present a major problem.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hidden-host">
<title>hidden_host</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will skip the host name part of <link linkend="hostname">$hostname</link> variable
when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the
cut-off of first-level domains.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hide-limited">
<title>hide_limited</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
by limiting, in the thread tree.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hide-missing">
<title>hide_missing</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the
thread tree.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hide-thread-subject">
<title>hide_thread_subject</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will not show the subject of messages in the thread
tree that have the same subject as their parent or closest previously
displayed sibling.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hide-top-limited">
<title>hide_top_limited</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
by limiting, at the top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when
<link linkend="hide-limited">$hide_limited</link> is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, this option will have no effect.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hide-top-missing">
<title>hide_top_missing</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the
top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when <link linkend="hide-missing">$hide_missing</link> is
<emphasis>set</emphasis>, this option will have no effect.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="history">
<title>history</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 10</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
the string history buffer per category. The buffer is cleared each time the
variable is set.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="history-file">
<title>history_file</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>~/.mutthistory</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
The file in which Mutt will save its history.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="honor-disposition">
<title>honor_disposition</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will not display attachments with a
disposition of <quote>attachment</quote> inline even if it could
render the part to plain text. These MIME parts can only
be viewed from the attachment menu.
</para>
<para>
If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, Mutt will render all MIME parts it can
properly transform to plain text.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="honor-followup-to">
<title>honor_followup_to</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
honored when group-replying to a message.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="hostname">
<title>hostname</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the system mutt is running on
containing the host's name and the DNS domain it belongs to. It is used
as the domain part (after <quote>@</quote>) for local email addresses as well as
Message-Id headers.
</para>
<para>
Its value is determined at startup as follows: If the node's name
as returned by the <literal>uname(3)</literal> function contains the hostname and the
domain, these are used to construct <link linkend="hostname">$hostname</link>. If there is no
domain part returned, Mutt will look for a <quote>domain</quote> or <quote>search</quote>
line in <literal>/etc/resolv.conf</literal> to determine the domain. Optionally, Mutt
can be compiled with a fixed domain name in which case a detected
one is not used.
</para>
<para>
Also see <link linkend="use-domain">$use_domain</link> and <link linkend="hidden-host">$hidden_host</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ignore-linear-white-space">
<title>ignore_linear_white_space</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This option replaces linear-white-space between encoded-word
and text to a single space to prevent the display of MIME-encoded
<quote>Subject:</quote> field from being divided into multiple lines.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ignore-list-reply-to">
<title>ignore_list_reply_to</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Affects the behavior of the <literal>&lt;reply&gt;</literal> function when replying to
messages from mailing lists (as defined by the <quote><link linkend="subscribe">subscribe</link></quote> or
<quote><link linkend="lists">lists</link></quote> commands).  When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, if the <quote>Reply-To:</quote> field is
set to the same value as the <quote>To:</quote> field, Mutt assumes that the
<quote>Reply-To:</quote> field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
mailing list when this option is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, use the <literal><link linkend="list-reply">&lt;list-reply&gt;</link></literal>
function; <literal>&lt;group-reply&gt;</literal> will reply to both the sender and the
list.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-authenticators">
<title>imap_authenticators</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt should
try them.  Authentication methods are either <quote>login</quote> or the right
side of an IMAP <quote>AUTH=xxx</quote> capability string, e.g. <quote>digest-md5</quote>, <quote>gssapi</quote>
or <quote>cram-md5</quote>. This option is case-insensitive. If it's
<emphasis>unset</emphasis> (the default) mutt will try all available methods,
in order from most-secure to least-secure.
</para>
<para>
Example:

</para>

<screen>
set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram-md5:login"
</screen><para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-check-subscribed">
<title>imap_check_subscribed</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders from
your server on connection, and add them to the set of mailboxes
it polls for new mail just as if you had issued individual <quote><link linkend="mailboxes">mailboxes</link></quote>
commands.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-delim-chars">
<title>imap_delim_chars</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>/.</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat
as folder separators for displaying IMAP paths. In particular it
helps in using the <quote>=</quote> shortcut for your <emphasis>folder</emphasis> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-headers">
<title>imap_headers</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Mutt requests these header fields in addition to the default headers
(<quote>Date:</quote>, <quote>From:</quote>, <quote>Subject:</quote>, <quote>To:</quote>, <quote>Cc:</quote>, <quote>Message-Id:</quote>,
<quote>References:</quote>, <quote>Content-Type:</quote>, <quote>Content-Description:</quote>, <quote>In-Reply-To:</quote>,
<quote>Reply-To:</quote>, <quote>Lines:</quote>, <quote>List-Post:</quote>, <quote>X-Label:</quote>) from IMAP
servers before displaying the index menu. You may want to add more
headers for spam detection.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> This is a space separated list, items should be uppercase
and not contain the colon, e.g. <quote>X-BOGOSITY X-SPAM-STATUS</quote> for the
<quote>X-Bogosity:</quote> and <quote>X-Spam-Status:</quote> header fields.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-idle">
<title>imap_idle</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will attempt to use the IMAP IDLE extension
to check for new mail in the current mailbox. Some servers
(dovecot was the inspiration for this option) react badly
to mutt's implementation. If your connection seems to freeze
up periodically, try unsetting this.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-keepalive">
<title>imap_keepalive</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 900</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that mutt
will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
from closing them before mutt has finished with them. The default is
well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-list-subscribed">
<title>imap_list_subscribed</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
IMAP browser with the <literal>&lt;toggle-subscribed&gt;</literal> function.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-login">
<title>imap_login</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Your login name on the IMAP server.
</para>
<para>
This variable defaults to the value of <link linkend="imap-user">$imap_user</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-pass">
<title>imap_pass</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, Mutt will
prompt you for your password when you invoke the <literal>&lt;imap-fetch-mail&gt;</literal> function
or try to open an IMAP folder.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Warning</emphasis>: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even
if you are the only one who can read the file.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-passive">
<title>imap_passive</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
mail.  Mutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted to
user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or if opening the connection
is slow.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-peek">
<title>imap_peek</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
exists to appease speed freaks.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-pipeline-depth">
<title>imap_pipeline_depth</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 15</literallayout>

<para>
Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued up before they
are sent to the server. A deeper pipeline reduces the amount of time
mutt must wait for the server, and can make IMAP servers feel much
more responsive. But not all servers correctly handle pipelined commands,
so if you have problems you might want to try setting this variable to 0.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> Changes to this variable have no effect on open connections.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-servernoise">
<title>imap_servernoise</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
server as error messages. Since these messages are often
harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
them at some point.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-user">
<title>imap_user</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP
server.
</para>
<para>
This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="implicit-autoview">
<title>implicit_autoview</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If set to <quote>yes</quote>, mutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
<quote><literal>copiousoutput</literal></quote> flag set for <emphasis>every</emphasis> MIME attachment it doesn't have
an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, mutt will
use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
form.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="include">
<title>include</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</literallayout>

<para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="include-onlyfirst">
<title>include_onlyfirst</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether or not Mutt includes only the first attachment
of the message you are replying.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="indent-string">
<title>indent_string</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>&gt; </literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.
</para>
<para>
The value of this option is ignored if <link linkend="text-flowed">$text_flowed</link> is set, too because
the quoting mechanism is strictly defined for format=flowed.
</para>
<para>
This option is a format string, please see the description of
<link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> for supported <literal>printf(3)</literal>-style sequences.

<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&amp;%4c?) %s</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
your personal taste.
</para>
<para>
<quote>Format strings</quote> are similar to the strings used in the C

<para>
<quote>Soft-fill</quote> deserves some explanation: Normal right-justification
will print everything to the left of the <quote>%&gt;</quote>, displaying padding and
whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
soft-fill gives priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space
to display it and showing padding only if there's still room. If
necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for
rightward text.

When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, the screen
is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
(useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="message-cache-clean">
<title>message_cache_clean</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will clean out obsolete entries from the message cache when

Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Set this to a directory and mutt will cache copies of messages from
your IMAP and POP servers here. You are free to remove entries at any
time.
</para>
<para>
When setting this variable to a directory, mutt needs to fetch every
remote message only once and can perform regular expression searches
as fast as for local folders.

<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
set as if the user had pressed the Esc key and whatever key remains
after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
has an ASCII value of <literal>0xf8</literal>, then this is treated as if the user had
pressed Esc then <quote>x</quote>.  This is because the result of removing the
high bit from <literal>0xf8</literal> is <literal>0x78</literal>, which is the ASCII character
<quote>x</quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="metoo">
<title>metoo</title>

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="mh-purge">
<title>mh_purge</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, mutt will mimic mh's behavior and rename deleted messages
to <emphasis>,&lt;old file name&gt;</emphasis> in mh folders instead of really deleting
them. This leaves the message on disk but makes programs reading the folder
ignore it. If the variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the message files will simply be
deleted.
</para>
<para>
This option is similar to <link linkend="maildir-trash">$maildir_trash</link> for Maildir folders.

</sect2>

<sect2 id="mime-forward">
<title>mime_forward</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
separate <literal>message/rfc822</literal> MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
variable to <quote>ask-no</quote> or <quote>ask-yes</quote>.
</para>
<para>

<para>
Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into <literal>text/plain</literal> when
forwarding a message while <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is <emphasis>set</emphasis>. Otherwise
<link linkend="forward-decode">$forward_decode</link> is used instead.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="mime-forward-rest">
<title>mime_forward_rest</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption

<sect2 id="mixmaster">
<title>mixmaster</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>mixmaster</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster binary on your
system.  It is used with various sets of parameters to gather the
list of known remailers, and to finally send a message through the
mixmaster chain.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="move">
<title>move</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether or not Mutt will move read messages
from your spool mailbox to your <link linkend="mbox">$mbox</link> mailbox, or as a result of
a <quote><link linkend="mbox-hook">mbox-hook</link></quote> command.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="narrow-tree">
<title>narrow_tree</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

deeper threads to fit on the screen.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="net-inc">
<title>net_inc</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 10</literallayout>

<para>

<sect2 id="pager">
<title>pager</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>builtin</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
messages. The value <quote>builtin</quote> means to use the built-in pager, otherwise this
variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
like to use.
</para>
<para>
Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional
keystrokes are necessary because you can't call mutt functions
directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer than
the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pager-context">
<title>pager_context</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
when displaying the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By
default, Mutt will display the line after the last one on the screen
at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).
</para>
<para>
This variable also specifies the amount of context given for search
results. If positive, this many lines will be given before a match,
if 0, the match will be top-aligned.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pager-format">
<title>pager_format</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s%*  -- (%P)</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls the format of the one-line message <quote>status</quote>
displayed before each message in either the internal or an external
pager.  The valid sequences are listed in the <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>
section.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pager-index-lines">
<title>pager_index_lines</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
remain to be read in the current thread.  One of the lines is reserved
for the status bar from the index, so a setting of 6
will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value of 0 results in
no index being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder
is less than <link linkend="pager-index-lines">$pager_index_lines</link>, then the index will only use as
many lines as it needs.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pager-stop">
<title>pager_stop</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the internal-pager will <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> move to the next message
when you are at the end of a message and invoke the <literal>&lt;next-page&gt;</literal>
function.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pgp-auto-decode">
<title>pgp_auto_decode</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will automatically attempt to decrypt traditional PGP
messages whenever the user performs an operation which ordinarily would
result in the contents of the message being operated on.  For example,
if the user displays a pgp-traditional message which has not been manually
checked with the <literal><link linkend="check-traditional-pgp">&lt;check-traditional-pgp&gt;</link></literal> function, mutt will automatically
check the message for traditional pgp.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pgp-autoinline">
<title>pgp_autoinline</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style inline
(traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain
circumstances.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp menu,
when inline is not required.
</para>
<para>
Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
which consist of more than a single MIME part.  Mutt can be
configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
(traditional) would not work.
</para>
<para>
Also see the <link linkend="pgp-mime-auto">$pgp_mime_auto</link> variable.

<sect2 id="pgp-check-exit">
<title>pgp_check_exit</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pgp-replyinline">
<title>pgp_replyinline</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to
create an inline (traditional) message when replying to a
message which is PGP encrypted/signed inline.  This can be
overridden by use of the pgp menu, when inline is not
required.  This option does not automatically detect if the
(replied-to) message is inline; instead it relies on Mutt
internals for previously checked/flagged messages.
</para>
<para>
Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
which consist of more than a single MIME part.  Mutt can be
configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
(traditional) would not work.

option is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
external command specified by <link linkend="print-command">$print_command</link>.  If this option
is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, no processing will be applied to the message when
printing it.  The latter setting may be useful if you are using
some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format
e-mail messages for printing.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="print-split">
<title>print_split</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="query-command">
<title>query_command</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This specifies the command Mutt will use to make external address
queries.  The string may contain a <quote>%s</quote>, which will be substituted
with the query string the user types.  Mutt will add quotes around the
string substituted for <quote>%s</quote> automatically according to shell quoting
rules, so you should avoid adding your own.  If no <quote>%s</quote> is found in
the string, Mutt will append the user's query to the end of the string.
See <quote><link linkend="query">query</link></quote> for more information.

<para>
This variable controls whether <quote>quit</quote> and <quote>exit</quote> actually quit
from mutt.  If this option is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, they do quit, if it is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, they
have no effect, and if it is set to <emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> or <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis>, you are
prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.

<sect2 id="quote-regexp">
<title>quote_regexp</title>
<literallayout>Type: regular expression
Default: <quote><literal>^([ \t]*[|&gt;:}#])+</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
A regular expression used in the internal pager to determine quoted
sections of text in the body of a message. Quoted text may be filtered
out using the <literal>&lt;toggle-quoted&gt;</literal> command, or colored according to the
<quote>color quoted</quote> family of directives.
</para>
<para>
Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently (<quote>color quoted1</quote>,
<quote>color quoted2</quote>, etc.). The quoting level is determined by removing
the last character from the matched text and recursively reapplying
the regular expression until it fails to produce a match.
</para>
<para>
Match detection may be overridden by the <link linkend="smileys">$smileys</link> regular expression.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="read-inc">
<title>read_inc</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 10</literallayout>

<para>
If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display which message it
is currently on when reading a mailbox or when performing search actions
such as search and limit. The message is printed after
this many messages have been read or searched (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will
print a message when it is at message 25, and then again when it gets
to message 50).  This variable is meant to indicate progress when
reading or searching large mailboxes which may take some time.
When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
the mailbox.

Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies what <quote>real</quote> or <quote>personal</quote> name should be used
when sending messages.
</para>
<para>
By default, this is the GECOS field from <literal>/etc/passwd</literal>.  Note that this
variable will <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used when the user has set a real name
in the <link linkend="from">$from</link> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="recall">
<title>recall</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether or not Mutt recalls postponed messages
when composing a new message.

Default: <quote><literal>~/sent</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of
your messages, but another way to do this is using the <quote><link linkend="my-hdr">my_hdr</link></quote>
command to create a <quote>Bcc:</quote> field with your email address in it.)
</para>
<para>
The value of <emphasis><link linkend="record">$record</link></emphasis> is overridden by the <link linkend="force-name">$force_name</link> and

<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, when replying to a message, Mutt will use the address listed
in the Reply-to: header as the recipient of the reply.  If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>,
it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
header field to the list address and you want to send a private
message to the author of a message.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="resolve">
<title>resolve</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next

current message is executed.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="reverse-alias">
<title>reverse_alias</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the <quote>personal</quote>
name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
alias:

</para>

<screen>
alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)
</screen><para>
and then you receive mail which contains the following header:

</para>

<screen>
From: abd30425@somewhere.net
</screen><para>
It would be displayed in the index menu as <quote>Joe User</quote> instead of
<quote>abd30425@somewhere.net.</quote>  This is useful when the person's e-mail
address is not human friendly.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="reverse-name">
<title>reverse_name</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
from there.  If this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the default <emphasis>From:</emphasis> line of
the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
messages you are replying to <emphasis role="bold">if</emphasis> that address matches your
<quote><link linkend="alternates">alternates</link></quote>.  If the variable is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, or the address that would be
used doesn't match your <quote><link linkend="alternates">alternates</link></quote>, the <emphasis>From:</emphasis> line will use
your address on the current machine.

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="reverse-realname">
<title>reverse_realname</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This variable fine-tunes the behavior of the <link linkend="reverse-name">$reverse_name</link> feature.
When it is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will use the address from incoming messages as-is,
possibly including eventual real names.  When it is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, mutt will
override any such real names with the setting of the <link linkend="realname">$realname</link> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="rfc2047-parameters">
<title>rfc2047_parameters</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will decode RFC2047-encoded MIME
parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt suggests you
to save attachments to files named like:

</para>

<screen>
=?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
</screen><para>
When this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis> interactively, the change won't be
active until you change folders.
</para>
<para>
Note that this use of RFC2047's encoding is explicitly
prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
wild.
</para>
<para>
Also note that setting this parameter will <emphasis>not</emphasis> have the effect
that mutt <emphasis>generates</emphasis> this kind of encoding.  Instead, mutt will
unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="save-address">
<title>save_address</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
default folder for saving a mail. If <link linkend="save-name">$save_name</link> or <link linkend="force-name">$force_name</link>

<link linkend="history-file">$history_file</link> file.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="save-name">
<title>save_name</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
the <link linkend="folder">$folder</link> directory with the <emphasis>username</emphasis> part of the
recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
<link linkend="record">$record</link> mailbox.
</para>
<para>
Also see the <link linkend="force-name">$force_name</link> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="score">
<title>score</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When this variable is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, scoring is turned off.  This can
be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
<link linkend="score-threshold-delete">$score_threshold_delete</link> variable and related are used.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="score-threshold-delete">
<title>score_threshold_delete</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: -1</literallayout>

<para>
Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by mutt.  Since
mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="score-threshold-flag">
<title>score_threshold_flag</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 9999</literallayout>

<para>
Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
of this variable are automatically marked as read by mutt.  Since
mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
of this variable will never mark a message read.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="search-context">
<title>search_context</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
For the pager, this variable specifies the number of lines shown
before search results. By default, search results will be top-aligned.
</para>

<sect2 id="send-charset">
<title>send_charset</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
A colon-delimited list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the
first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
If your <link linkend="charset">$charset</link> is not <quote>iso-8859-1</quote> and recipients may not
understand <quote>UTF-8</quote>, it is advisable to include in the list an
appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
<quote>iso-8859-2</quote>, <quote>koi8-r</quote> or <quote>iso-2022-jp</quote>) either instead of or after
<quote>iso-8859-1</quote>.
</para>
<para>
In case the text cannot be converted into one of these exactly,
mutt uses <link linkend="charset">$charset</link> as a fallback.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sendmail">
<title>sendmail</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt.
Mutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
arguments as recipient addresses.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sendmail-wait">
<title>sendmail_wait</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the <link linkend="sendmail">$sendmail</link> process
to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.
</para>
<para>
Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:

</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols="2">

will be informed as to where to find the output.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="shell">
<title>shell</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Command to use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user's login
shell from <literal>/etc/passwd</literal> is used.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sig-dashes">
<title>sig_dashes</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, a line containing <quote>-- </quote> (note the trailing space) will be inserted before your
<link linkend="signature">$signature</link>.  It is <emphasis role="bold">strongly</emphasis> recommended that you not <emphasis>unset</emphasis>
this variable unless your signature contains just your name.  The
reason for this is because many software packages use <quote>-- \n</quote> to
detect your signature.  For example, Mutt has the ability to highlight
the signature in a different color in the built-in pager.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sig-on-top">
<title>sig_on_top</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
text.  It is <emphasis role="bold">strongly</emphasis> recommended that you do not set this variable
unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
some heat from netiquette guardians.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="signature">
<title>signature</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: <quote><literal>~/.signature</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (<quote>|</quote>), it is
assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
its standard output.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="simple-search">
<title>simple_search</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>~f %s | ~s %s</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a real search
pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the <quote>~</quote> pattern
operators.  See <quote><link linkend="patterns">patterns</link></quote> for more information on search patterns.
</para>
<para>
For example, if you simply type <quote>joe</quote> at a search or limit prompt, Mutt
will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable by
replacing <quote>%s</quote> with the supplied string.
For the default value, <quote>joe</quote> would be expanded to: <quote>~f joe | ~s joe</quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sleep-time">
<title>sleep_time</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 1</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging
messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so
a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="smart-wrap">
<title>smart_wrap</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls the display of lines longer than the screen width in the
internal pager. If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If
<emphasis>unset</emphasis>, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
<link linkend="markers">$markers</link> variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="smileys">
<title>smileys</title>
<literallayout>Type: regular expression
Default: <quote><literal>(&gt;From )|(:[-^]?[][)(&gt;&lt;}{|/DP])</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
The <emphasis>pager</emphasis> uses this variable to catch some common false
positives of <link linkend="quote-regexp">$quote_regexp</link>, most notably smileys and not consider
a line quoted text if it also matches <link linkend="smileys">$smileys</link>. This mostly
happens at the beginning of a line.

<sect2 id="smime-certificates">
<title>smime_certificates</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, mutt has to handle
storage and retrieval of keys by itself. This is very basic right
now, and keys and certificates are stored in two different
directories, both named as the hash-value retrieved from
OpenSSL. There is an index file which contains mailbox-address
keyid pairs, and which can be manually edited. This option points to
the location of the certificates.

Defines the SMTP smarthost where sent messages should relayed for
delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:

</para>

<screen>
smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]
</screen><para>
where <quote>[...]</quote> denotes an optional part.
Setting this variable overrides the value of the <link linkend="sendmail">$sendmail</link>
variable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sort">
<title>sort</title>
<literallayout>Type: sort order
Default: date</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies how to sort messages in the <quote>index</quote> menu.  Valid values
are:

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>date or date-sent
</para></listitem><listitem><para>date-received
</para></listitem><listitem><para>from
</para></listitem><listitem><para>mailbox-order (unsorted)
</para></listitem><listitem><para>score

</para></listitem><listitem><para>spam
</para></listitem><listitem><para>subject
</para></listitem><listitem><para>threads
</para></listitem><listitem><para>to
</para></listitem></itemizedlist>

<para>
You may optionally use the <quote>reverse-</quote> prefix to specify reverse sorting
order (example: <quote><literal>set sort=reverse-date-sent</literal></quote>).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sort-alias">
<title>sort_alias</title>
<literallayout>Type: sort order
Default: alias</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies how the entries in the <quote>alias</quote> menu are sorted.  The
following are legal values:

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>address (sort alphabetically by email address)
</para></listitem><listitem><para>alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
</para></listitem><listitem><para>unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)
</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sort-aux">
<title>sort_aux</title>
<literallayout>Type: sort order
Default: date</literallayout>

<para>
When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
are sorted.  This can be set to any value that <link linkend="sort">$sort</link> can, except
<quote>threads</quote> (in that case, mutt will just use <quote>date-sent</quote>).  You can also
specify the <quote>last-</quote> prefix in addition to the <quote>reverse-</quote> prefix, but <quote>last-</quote>
must come after <quote>reverse-</quote>.  The <quote>last-</quote> prefix causes messages to be
sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
the rest of <link linkend="sort-aux">$sort_aux</link> as an ordering.  For instance,

</para>

<screen>
set sort_aux=last-date-received
</screen><para>
would mean that if a new message is received in a
thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
you have <quote><literal>set sort=reverse-threads</literal></quote>.)
</para>
<para>
Note: For reversed <link linkend="sort">$sort</link>
order <link linkend="sort-aux">$sort_aux</link> is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sort-browser">
<title>sort_browser</title>
<literallayout>Type: sort order
Default: alpha</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.  By default, the
entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>alpha (alphabetically)
</para></listitem><listitem><para>date
</para></listitem><listitem><para>size
</para></listitem><listitem><para>unsorted
</para></listitem></itemizedlist>

<para>
You may optionally use the <quote>reverse-</quote> prefix to specify reverse sorting
order (example: <quote><literal>set sort_browser=reverse-date</literal></quote>).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sort-re">
<title>sort_re</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
<link linkend="strict-threads">$strict_threads</link> <emphasis>unset</emphasis>.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With <link linkend="sort-re">$sort_re</link> <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will
only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
setting of <link linkend="reply-regexp">$reply_regexp</link>.  With <link linkend="sort-re">$sort_re</link> <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, mutt will attach
the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
non-<link linkend="reply-regexp">$reply_regexp</link> parts of both messages are identical.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="spam-separator">
<title>spam_separator</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>,</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
This variable controls what happens when multiple spam headers
are matched: if <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, each successive header will overwrite any
previous matches value for the spam label. If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, each successive
match will append to the previous, using this variable's value as a
separator.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="spoolfile">
<title>spoolfile</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot find
it, you can specify its location with this variable.  Mutt will
initially set this variable to the value of the environment
variable <literal>$MAIL</literal> or <literal>$MAILDIR</literal> if either is defined.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-ca-certificates-file">
<title>ssl_ca_certificates_file</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA certificates.
Any server certificate that is signed with one of these CA
certificates is also automatically accepted.
</para>
<para>
Example:

</para>

<screen>
set ssl_ca_certificates_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
</screen></sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-client-cert">
<title>ssl_client_cert</title>

<para>
The file containing a client certificate and its associated private
key.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-force-tls">
<title>ssl_force_tls</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If this variable is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will require that all connections
to remote servers be encrypted. Furthermore it will attempt to
negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the capability,
since it would otherwise have to abort the connection anyway. This
option supersedes <link linkend="ssl-starttls">$ssl_starttls</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-min-dh-prime-bits">
<title>ssl_min_dh_prime_bits</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies the minimum acceptable prime size (in bits)
for use in any Diffie-Hellman key exchange. A value of 0 will use
the default from the GNUTLS library.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-starttls">
<title>ssl_starttls</title>
<literallayout>Type: quadoption
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis> (the default), mutt will attempt to use <literal>STARTTLS</literal> on servers
advertising the capability. When <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, mutt will not attempt to
use <literal>STARTTLS</literal> regardless of the server's capabilities.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-use-sslv2">
<title>ssl_use_sslv2</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies whether to attempt to use SSLv2 in the
SSL authentication process.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-use-sslv3">
<title>ssl_use_sslv3</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies whether to attempt to use SSLv3 in the
SSL authentication process.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-use-tlsv1">
<title>ssl_use_tlsv1</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
This variable specifies whether to attempt to use TLSv1 in the
SSL authentication process.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-usesystemcerts">
<title>ssl_usesystemcerts</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, mutt will use CA certificates in the
system-wide certificate store when checking if a server certificate
is signed by a trusted CA.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-verify-dates">
<title>ssl_verify_dates</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis> (the default), mutt will not automatically accept a server
certificate that is either not yet valid or already expired. You should
only unset this for particular known hosts, using the
<literal><link linkend="account-hook">&lt;account-hook&gt;</link></literal> function.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ssl-verify-host">
<title>ssl_verify_host</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis> (the default), mutt will not automatically accept a server
certificate whose host name does not match the host used in your folder
URL. You should only unset this for particular known hosts, using
the <literal><link linkend="account-hook">&lt;account-hook&gt;</link></literal> function.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="status-chars">
<title>status_chars</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>-*%A</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Controls the characters used by the <quote>%r</quote> indicator in
<link linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>. The first character is used when the mailbox is
unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox has been changed, and
it needs to be resynchronized. The third is used if the mailbox is in
read-only mode, or if the mailbox will not be written when exiting
that mailbox (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
with the <literal>&lt;toggle-write&gt;</literal> operation, bound by default to <quote>%</quote>). The fourth
is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened in attach-
message mode (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying,
forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="status-format">
<title>status_format</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal>-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%&gt;-(%P)---</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Controls the format of the status line displayed in the <quote>index</quote>
menu.  This string is similar to <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>, but has its own
set of <literal>printf(3)</literal>-like sequences:

</para>

</para>
<para>
* = can be optionally printed if nonzero
</para>
<para>
Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
of the above sequences, the following construct is used:
</para>
<para>
<literal>%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?</literal>
</para>
<para>
where <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is a character from the table above, and
<emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> is the string you would like printed if
<emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is nonzero.  <emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">may</emphasis> contain
other sequences as well as normal text, but you may <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> nest
optional strings.
</para>
<para>
Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
new messages in a mailbox:
</para>
<para>
<literal>%?n?%n new messages.?</literal>
</para>
<para>
You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
</para>
<para>
<literal>%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?</literal>
</para>
<para>
If the value of <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is non-zero, <emphasis>if_string</emphasis> will
be expanded, otherwise <emphasis>else_string</emphasis> will be expanded.
</para>
<para>
You can force the result of any <literal>printf(3)</literal>-like sequence to be lowercase
by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore (<quote>_</quote>) sign.
For example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase,
you would use: <quote><literal>%_h</literal></quote>.
</para>
<para>
If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (<quote>:</quote>) character, mutt
will replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful
with IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="status-on-top">
<title>status_on_top</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
Setting this variable causes the <quote>status bar</quote> to be displayed on
the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom. If <link linkend="help">$help</link>
is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, too it'll be placed at the bottom.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="strict-threads">
<title>strict_threads</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, threading will only make use of the <quote>In-Reply-To</quote> and
<quote>References:</quote> fields when you <link linkend="sort">$sort</link> by message threads.  By
default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
<quote>pseudo threads.</quote>. This may not always be desirable, such as in a
personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
the subjects like <quote>hi</quote> which will get grouped together. See also
<link linkend="sort-re">$sort_re</link> for a less drastic way of controlling this
behavior.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="suspend">
<title>suspend</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, mutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
<emphasis>susp</emphasis> key, usually <quote>^Z</quote>. This is useful if you run mutt
inside an xterm using a command like <quote><literal>xterm -e mutt</literal></quote>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="text-flowed">
<title>text_flowed</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will generate <quote>format=flowed</quote> bodies with a content type
of <quote><literal>text/plain; format=flowed</literal></quote>.
This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's
features, you'll need support in your editor.
</para>
<para>
Note that <link linkend="indent-string">$indent_string</link> is ignored when this option is <emphasis>set</emphasis>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="thorough-search">
<title>thorough_search</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Affects the <literal>~b</literal> and <literal>~h</literal> search operations described in
section <quote><link linkend="patterns">patterns</link></quote>.  If <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the headers and body/attachments of
messages to be searched are decoded before searching. If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>,
messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
</para>
<para>
Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters should <emphasis>set</emphasis>
this value because decoding also includes MIME parsing/decoding and possible
character set conversions. Otherwise mutt will attempt to match against the
raw message received (for example quoted-printable encoded or with encoded
headers) which may lead to incorrect search results.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="thread-received">
<title>thread_received</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
to thread messages by subject.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="tilde">
<title>tilde</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
screen with a tilde (<quote>~</quote>).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="time-inc">
<title>time_inc</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
Along with <link linkend="read-inc">$read_inc</link>, <link linkend="write-inc">$write_inc</link>, and <link linkend="net-inc">$net_inc</link>, this
variable controls the frequency with which progress updates are
displayed. It suppresses updates less than <link linkend="time-inc">$time_inc</link> milliseconds
apart. This can improve throughput on systems with slow terminals,
or when running mutt on a remote system.
</para>
<para>
Also see the <quote><link linkend="tuning">tuning</link></quote> section of the manual for performance considerations.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="timeout">
<title>timeout</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 600</literallayout>

<para>
When Mutt is waiting for user input either idling in menus or
in an interactive prompt, Mutt would block until input is
present. Depending on the context, this would prevent certain
operations from working, like checking for new mail or keeping
an IMAP connection alive.
</para>
<para>
This variable controls how many seconds Mutt will at most wait
until it aborts waiting for input, performs these operations and
continues to wait for input.
</para>
<para>
A value of zero or less will cause Mutt to never time out.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="tmpdir">
<title>tmpdir</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its
temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.  If
this variable is not set, the environment variable <literal>$TMPDIR</literal> is
used.  If <literal>$TMPDIR</literal> is not set then <quote><literal>/tmp</literal></quote> is used.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="to-chars">
<title>to_chars</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: <quote><literal> +TCFL</literal></quote></literallayout>

<para>
Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.  The
first character is the one used when the mail is <emphasis>not</emphasis> addressed to your
address.  The second is used when you are the only
recipient of the message.  The third is when your address
appears in the <quote>To:</quote> header field, but you are not the only recipient of
the message.  The fourth character is used when your
address is specified in the <quote>Cc:</quote> header field, but you are not the only
recipient.  The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent
by <emphasis>you</emphasis>.  The sixth character is used to indicate when a mail
was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="tunnel">
<title>tunnel</title>
<literallayout>Type: string
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a command
instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. Example:

</para>

<screen>
set tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"
</screen><para>
Note: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
machine without having to enter a password.
</para>
<para>
When set, Mutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.
Please see <quote><link linkend="account-hook">account-hook</link></quote> in the manual for how to use different
tunnel commands per connection.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="uncollapse-jump">
<title>uncollapse_jump</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
when the current thread is <emphasis>un</emphasis>collapsed.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="use-8bitmime">
<title>use_8bitmime</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Warning:</emphasis> do not set this variable unless you are using a version
of sendmail which supports the <literal>-B8BITMIME</literal> flag (such as sendmail
8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
</para>
<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will invoke <link linkend="sendmail">$sendmail</link> with the <literal>-B8BITMIME</literal>
flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="use-domain">
<title>use_domain</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
<quote>@host</quote> portion) with the value of <link linkend="hostname">$hostname</link>.  If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, no
addresses will be qualified.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="use-envelope-from">
<title>use_envelope_from</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: no</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will set the <emphasis>envelope</emphasis> sender of the message.
If <link linkend="envelope-from-address">$envelope_from_address</link> is <emphasis>set</emphasis>, it will be used as the sender
address. If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, mutt will attempt to derive the sender from the
<quote>From:</quote> header.
</para>
<para>
Note that this information is passed to sendmail command using the
<literal>-f</literal> command line switch. Therefore setting this option is not useful
if the <link linkend="sendmail">$sendmail</link> variable already contains <literal>-f</literal> or if the
executable pointed to by <link linkend="sendmail">$sendmail</link> doesn't support the <literal>-f</literal> switch.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="use-from">
<title>use_from</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will generate the <quote>From:</quote> header field when
sending messages.  If <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, no <quote>From:</quote> header field will be
generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the <quote><link linkend="my-hdr">my_hdr</link></quote>
command.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="use-idn">
<title>use_idn</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will show you international domain names decoded.
Note: You can use IDNs for addresses even if this is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>.
This variable only affects decoding.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="use-ipv6">
<title>use_ipv6</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
contact.  If this option is <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, Mutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
Normally, the default should work.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="user-agent">
<title>user_agent</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will add a <quote>User-Agent:</quote> header to outgoing
messages, indicating which version of mutt was used for composing
them.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="visual">
<title>visual</title>
<literallayout>Type: path
Default: (empty)</literallayout>

<para>
Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the <quote><literal>~v</literal></quote> command is
given in the built-in editor.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="wait-key">

Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after an external command
has been invoked by these functions: <literal>&lt;shell-escape&gt;</literal>,
<literal>&lt;pipe-message&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;pipe-entry&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;print-message&gt;</literal>,
and <literal>&lt;print-entry&gt;</literal> commands.
</para>
<para>
It is also used when viewing attachments with <quote><link linkend="auto-view">auto_view</link></quote>, provided
that the corresponding mailcap entry has a <emphasis>needsterminal</emphasis> flag,
and the external program is interactive.
</para>
<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, Mutt will always ask for a key. When <emphasis>unset</emphasis>, Mutt will wait
for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="weed">
<title>weed</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, mutt will weed headers when displaying, forwarding,
printing, or replying to messages.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="wrap">
<title>wrap</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
When set to a positive value, mutt will wrap text at <link linkend="wrap">$wrap</link> characters.
When set to a negative value, mutt will wrap text so that there are <link linkend="wrap">$wrap</link>
characters of empty space on the right side of the terminal. Setting it
to zero makes mutt wrap at the terminal width.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="wrap-headers">
<title>wrap_headers</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 78</literallayout>

<para>
This option specifies the number of characters to use for wrapping
an outgoing message's headers. Allowed values are between 78 and 998
inclusive.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> This option usually shouldn't be changed. RFC5233
recommends a line length of 78 (the default), so <emphasis role="bold">please only change
this setting when you know what you're doing</emphasis>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="wrap-search">
<title>wrap_search</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether searches wrap around the end.
</para>
<para>
When <emphasis>set</emphasis>, searches will wrap around the first (or last) item. When
<emphasis>unset</emphasis>, incremental searches will not wrap.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="wrapmargin">
<title>wrapmargin</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 0</literallayout>

<para>
(DEPRECATED) Equivalent to setting <link linkend="wrap">$wrap</link> with a negative value.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="write-bcc">
<title>write_bcc</title>
<literallayout>Type: boolean
Default: yes</literallayout>

<para>
Controls whether mutt writes out the <quote>Bcc:</quote> header when preparing
messages to be sent.  Exim users may wish to unset this. If mutt
is set to deliver directly via SMTP (see <link linkend="smtp-url">$smtp_url</link>), this
option does nothing: mutt will never write out the <quote>Bcc:</quote> header
in this case.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="write-inc">
<title>write_inc</title>
<literallayout>Type: number
Default: 10</literallayout>

<para>
When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
<link linkend="write-inc">$write_inc</link> messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a
single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.
</para>
<para>
Also see the <link linkend="read-inc">$read_inc</link>, <link linkend="net-inc">$net_inc</link> and <link linkend="time-inc">$time_inc</link> variables and the
<quote><link linkend="tuning">tuning</link></quote> section of the manual for performance considerations.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect1 id="functions">
<title>Functions</title>

<para>
The following is the list of available functions listed by the mapping
in which they are available.  The default key setting is given, and an
explanation of what the function does.  The key bindings of these
functions can be changed with the <link linkend="bind">bind</link>
command.
</para>

<sect2 id="generic-map">
<title>Generic Menu</title>
<para>
The <emphasis>generic</emphasis> menu is not a real menu, but specifies common functions
(such as movement) available in all menus except for <emphasis>pager</emphasis> and
<emphasis>editor</emphasis>.  Changing settings for this menu will affect the default
bindings for all menus (except as noted).
