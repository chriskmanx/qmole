LibDOM -- an implementation of the W3C DOM
==========================================

Overview
--------

LibDOM is an implementation of the W3C DOM API in C.


Requirements
------------

The library uses the Netsurf core buildsystem which must be available
(usually at the same level as the libsvg source)

The PREFIX variable can be used to perform builds which do not install
to global system paths.

libdom requires the following tools:

 - A C99 capable C compiler
 - GNU make or compatible
 - Perl (for the testcases)

LibDOM also requires the following libraries to be installed:

 - LibParserUtils
 - LibWapcaplet
 - LibHubbub


Compilation
-----------

If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.

Invoke make:

  make

The VARIANT variable allows builds for "release" (the default) and "debug"
e.g.

  make VARIANT=debug


Verification
------------

To verify that the library is working, it is necessary to specify a
different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:

  make test


API documentation
-----------------

Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the
public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase
sources may also be of use in working out how to use it.
