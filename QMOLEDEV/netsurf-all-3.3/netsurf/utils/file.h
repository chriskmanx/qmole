/**
 * \file utils/file.h
 * \brief Default operations table for files.
 *
 * These are file operations that depend upon the filesystem the
 * browser is operating on. These allow the core browser functionality
 * to be filesystem agnostic.
 *
 * The provided defaults operate on POSIX path names with / as a
 * directory separator in a single hieracy from a root directory.
 *
 * Other path conventions require the default operations to be
 * overridden. For example windows frontend runs on a filesystem with
 * drive letter and a \\ as a separator.
