                      added possibility for the statusbar in non-fullscreen mode
                      added command line switch "I" to force display of the statusbar
                      changed command line switch ignore_path_sort from "I" to "P"
                      added command line switch "W" for a fixed zoom factor

1.7
===

 05.07.01 [----] [ak] added a qiv-command.example & released 1.7 :-)
 10.06.01 [pre9] [ak] added qiv_command_patch from post@volker-wysk.de
 03.06.01 [pre8] [ak] image_moving now uses func update_m_image. no screen clean first anymore -> faster moving :)
                      zoom now uses update_z_image -> a little bit faster zoom (+0.1s?)
                      added README.TODO
 11.05.01 [pre7] [wd] Fixed window-resizing in non-fullscreen mode.
                      Fixed combining -x with -m or -t.
 02.05.01 [pre6] [wd] Fixed mouse-hiding on button-push when fullscreen.
                      Added some missing names to the doc file.
 30.04.01 [pre5] [wd] Hide the mouse on keypress and button push when it is
                      in the qiv window (the mouse is re-shown on mouse
                      movement).  Improved the sort algorithms (particularly
                      the numeric sort).
 02.04.01 [pre4] [wd] rreaddir() patch.
 28.03.01 [pre3] [wd] Added undelete image command (bound to u & U).  Allow the
                      user to specify multiple -u options and also to specify
                      files on the commandline in addition to -uDIRs.  Added
                      new commandline sorting options (-I, -M, & -N).
                      Optimized rreaddir(), next_image(), and get_random().
                      Improved the implementation of shuffle.  Other misc.

1.6
===

  18.01.01 [1.6]  [ak] killed "pre8" string, -v (gzip) - we dont neet verbose mode *g*
                       release qiv 1.6
  06.01.01 [1.6]  [df] Put 'm' back in help text (oops!)
  06.01.01 [pre8] [df] Rewrote part of the extension filtering code.
  06.01.01 [pre8] [df] Move the program used to compress man pages
                       (gzip -9vf) up to the top so that it can be
                       disabled easily.
  06.01.01 [pre8] [df] Some HP-UX compilation fixes.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Change zoom_in/zoom_out so that they will break
                       out of maxpect/scale_down mode, and make
                       maxpect/scale_down override each other.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] A whole bunch of other cleanups.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Updated keys help text for rotation/moving.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Fixed bug that caused the image not to update
                       when brightness/contrast/gamma was re-adjusted
                       to 0/0/0 (with either the Enter key or B/C/G.)
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Merged README.SPEED_UP into README.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Don't reset image size when rotating, and scale
                       properly according to maxpect/scale_down.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Fold filter.c into main.c.
  05.01.01 [pre7] [df] Big cleanup: move everything pertaining to the
                       image into a qiv_image struct and pass that as
                       an argument to most functions. Got rid of a lot
                       of global variables.
  04.01.01 [pre6] [df] gzip manpage with -9 (This is required for
                       Debian packages, and is a good idea anywhere).
  04.01.01 [pre6] [df] Replace strcpy/strcat with strncpy/snprintf in
                       rreaddir and move2trash to prevent a few more
                       possible overflows.
  04.01.01 [pre6] [df] Clean up initialization code.
  04.01.01 [pre6] [df] Redo color handling: remove GDK deprecated
                       functions and internal color list. Now you can
                       use any color from X's rgb.txt or equivalent
                       (however, you may have to change '123456' to
                       '#123456').
  03.01.01 [pre5] [df] Fix Makefile to handle fonts with spaces in
                       their names.
  03.01.01 [pre5] [df] Use actual font height when drawing the help
                       screen and statusbar instead of hardcoding it.
  03.01.01 [pre5] [df] Plug text_font and statusbar_background_gc
                       memory leaks.
  03.01.01 [pre5] [df] Use helpstrs in show_help to avoid duplicating
                       the help text.
  03.01.01 [pre5] [df] Change raw keysyms to symbolic names in
                       event.c.
  02.01.01 [pre4] [df] Use NULL for the sentinel value in
                       image_extentions.
  02.01.01 [pre4] [df] Updated man page.
  02.01.01 [pre4] [df] Replace random() with rand(), since the
                       HAVE_RANDOM check didn't really work
                       properly, rand is guaranteed to be there,
                       and it's acceptible for the amount of
                       randomness we need. This facilitated some
                       more Makefile improvements.
  02.01.01 [pre4] [df] Reorganized the source layout a bit.
                       Optional code now lives in the lib/ dir.
  02.01.01 [pre4] [df] Resync Makefile.Solaris to Makefile, and
                       make some minor fixes to each.
  01.01.01 [pre3] [df] Updated -e to work properly with the new
                       centering stuff. This is now considered a
                       feature, not a workaround ;-)
  01.01.01 [pre3] [df] Put x and y hints into the window when we
                       create it (should eliminate the "window
                       pops up and then centers itself" problem.)
  01.01.01 [pre3] [df] Removed last traces of wm_handle kludge,
                       and set StaticGravity instead.
  31.12.00 [pre3] [df] Only call gdk_show_window on load, not
                       every single time we update.
  31.12.00 [pre3] [df] Replaced strsort with qsort. (should be
                       faster, doesn't have an illegal name ;-)
  31.12.00 [pre3] [df] Replaced sprintf with snprintf and
                       g_snprintf to prevent any possible overflows.
  31.12.00 [pre3] [df] Cleaned up some extraneous blank lines in
                       output.
  05.12.00 [pre2] [ak] another PPC fix.
  27.11.00 [pre1] [ak] changed "char c" to "int c" in options.c
                       not worked with char on Linux/ppc
                       (mailed by Jiri Masik <masik@darbujan.fzu.cz>)

  05.08.00 [pre3] [ak] cleaned up readmes..
  05.08.00 [pre2] [ak] changed up/down and left/right moving of the image.
                       now the stuff works like in ACDSee (Win).

===

  25.06.00 [pre4] [da] Sending a SIGUSR1 to qiv will cause the program to flip to next

  03.04.00 [pre1] [da] The delay time in slideshow mode used to include the time
                           it took for a picture to load.
                           Pressing '?' in non-fullscreen mode results in the help
                           being printed to stdout.

1.1
===

  27.04.99 [ak] added #include <string.h> to image.c
  21.04.99 [df] changed Makefile to use the system's getopt if it's
                availible, took the getopt section back out of
                README, updated install-xscreensaver to use -fitsd
                style options, fixed -h typo.
  21.04.99 [pa] Included GNU getopt_long sources and deleted the
                non-getopt code from options.c.
  20.04.99 [ak] kicked make test ;) now its in make install again.
  20.04.99 [df] added HAVE_GETOPT_LONG conditional compilation stuff
                for Solaris/FreeBSD, rescued xscreensaver stuff from
                install.sh into Makefile, shuffled INSTALL into README
                and reformatted a bit.
  20.04.99 [ak] kicked user_settings from qiv.h (nw in Makefile)
                added --help. small changes in manpage.
  19.04.99 [df] rewrote Makefile (replacing install.sh), fixed syntax
                of -e, rewrote option-parsing code to use getopt, axed
                really long usage message, header file reorg.
  17.04.99 [ak] removed prefix from install.sh. don't ask me why, but this
                don't works here with my bash 2.01 :(
  15.04.99 [de] Makefile changes/additions (test/debug targets)

  02.04.99 [pa] Reorganized everything to use events and not to eat up
                100% CPU time.  Got rid of sleep() in slideshow, thus
                making qiv react faster.  Random now works not only in
                slideshow. In random non-slideshow mode, terms "next
                image" and "previous image" are essentially the same,
                as they both are random.  Image jumping uses main
                event handler now.
  01.04.99 [pa] added utils.c patch for FreeBSD.
  22.02.99 [to/ak] added 8bpp patch for better to_root drawing.

                "Center Problem"..
