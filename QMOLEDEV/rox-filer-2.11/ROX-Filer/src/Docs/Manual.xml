   <para>
    <application>ROX-Filer</application> is a graphical file manger for the X
    Window System. Its user interface is based on the RISC OS filer and it
    supports similar features such as application directories and drag-and-drop
    loading and saving of files. The filer can also act as a pinboard, allowing
    you to pin frequently used files onto the desktop background.

 <chapter id="intro">
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
   <application>ROX-Filer</application> is a simple and easy to use graphical
   file manager for X11 &mdash; the windowing system used on Unix and Unix-like
   operating systems.  It is also the core component of the ROX Desktop
   <citation>ROX</citation>. Many of the filer's features were inspired by RISC
   OS <citation>RISC OS</citation>. `ROX' stands for `RISC OS&ndash;On&ndash;X'.

      <listitem><para>
        A common drag-and-drop protocol used, for example, by the GNOME
        desktop<citation>GNOME</citation>. This allows data to be loaded into an
        application by dragging it from a filer window to a program. The full
        specification is given in <citation>DND</citation>.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>XDS</term>
      <listitem><para>
        An extension to XDND that allows applications to save data by
        dragging an icon back to a filer window. The full specification is given in
        <citation>XDS</citation>.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>Basedir spec</term>
      <listitem><para>
        A simple, but flexible, system for managing user choices. By default, choices are
	saved under <filename>~/.config</filename>. However, you can change this by setting
	the <envar>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</envar> environment variable. See
        <citation>BaseDir</citation> for details.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>Application directories</term>
      <listitem><para>
        Self contained relocatable applications, where installation is as simple as
        copying it to where you want it and uninstalling it is just a matter of
        deleting a directory. Described later in this documentation.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>Thumbnails</term>
      <listitem><para>
        The filer can be made to display image files by using the image itself for the
        icon, instead of a generic `this-is-an-image' icon. Very useful for organising
        a directory full of photos! See <citation>Thumbs</citation> for details.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>Shared MIME Info Database</term>
      <listitem><para>
        In the past, each desktop had its own database of rules for determining the
	type of files. The Shared MIME Info Database<citation>SharedMIME</citation>
	unifies these into a single system shared by all desktops.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>Icon Themes</term>
      <listitem><para>
	Collections of file icons, called themes, can be installed (eg, to
	<filename>~/.icons</filename>). You can switch between themes in
	the Options box. Once other desktops support this fully, themes
	will be sharable between desktops. See <citation>IconTheme</citation> for details.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>DNotify support (Linux only)</term>
      <listitem><para>
        If used with a recent Linux kernel (2.4.x series), the filer will notice changes
	to directories automatically. On other systems, directories will update when the
	pointer is moved over them.

 <chapter id="invoking">
  <title>Invoking</title>
  <para>
   You should be able to start the filer by simply running the <userinput>rox</userinput>
   command, by typing it at a shell prompt or otherwise. If the filer isn't installed yet,
   consult <xref linkend="compiling"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   By default, <application>ROX-Filer</application> will start by displaying
   the current directory.  You can get it to display other directories instead
   by listing them after the command:

   <screen>$ rox /home /usr /usr/local</screen>

   You can also use it to open files, like this:

   <screen>$ rox README</screen>

   The filer supports various options; use <option>-h</option> for a list.
   All options have long and short forms (eg <option>-h</option> and
   <option>--help</option>) &mdash; although on some systems you can only use the
   short versions.
   </para><para>
   Note that if the same version of the filer is already running on this
   machine then, by default, it will be used to open the directories.
   </para><para>
   For a complete list of command-line options, see <xref linkend="manpage"/>
  </para>

  <sect1>
   <title><anchor id="run_pin" xreflabel="Pinboard support"/>Pinboard support</title>
   <para>

    If you want the filer to manage your desktop background then you use
    the <option>--pinboard</option> option and supply a name for the pinboard,
    eg:

    <screen>$ rox --pinboard=MyPinboard</screen>

    The pinboard configuration is saved in
    <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Filer/pb_MyPinboard</filename>
    as soon as you change it in some way (for example, by dropping a file
    onto the background). You can have as many pinboards as you like and
    switch between them by running rox again, eg:

    <screen>$ rox --pinboard=MyOtherPinboard</screen>

    To turn off the pinboard again, set the name to an empty string:

    <screen>$ rox --pinboard=</screen>

    See the <xref linkend="winman"/> if you have trouble getting the icons to
    display correctly. The pinboard may also be turned on and off by locating
    <filename>ROX-Filer</filename> in a filer window and choosing <guimenuitem>Enable
    pinboard</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Disable pinboard</guimenuitem> from the menu.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title><anchor id="run_pan" xreflabel="Panel support"/>Panels</title>
   <para>

    Panels work just like the pinboard, except that they run along the edge of the screen.
    To create a panel:

    <screen>$ rox -b=MyPanel</screen>

    The panel should be displayed in a window without a title bar. If
    this does not work then see the <xref linkend="winman"/> for some ideas.
    You can drag files onto either side of the panel to add them. Panel icons
    can be repositioned by dragging them with the middle mouse button.
    Changes to the panel are automatically saved to
    <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Filer/pan_MyPanel</filename>.
    As with the pinboard, you can switch between panel configurations
    simply by running rox again with a different panel name.

    <screen>$ rox -b=MyOtherPanel</screen>

    You can set which edge of the screen the panel appears on using the popup menu.
    You can also set the edge when enabling the panel by using the side instead of -b.
    Specify a blank name to remove the panel:

    <screen>$ rox --bottom=</screen>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title><anchor id="winman" xreflabel="window manager notes"/>Window manager notes</title>
   <para>
    You may have to play around with your window manager a bit to get
    the pinboard icons and panels to display correctly (eg, without borders
    and underneath all other windows). In particular, try setting the
    stacking level / depth to low (or a negative value). Make sure any
    'Keep transients above other windows' type options are turned off!
   </para>

   <sect2><title>Sawfish / sawmill</title>
    <para>
     Sawfish tries to guess whether you are using GNOME at start-up and only
     provides support if so. You may need to add the line
     <programlisting>(require 'gnome)</programlisting>
     to your <filename>.sawfishrc</filename> file (see the sawfish manual
     for more details).
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2><title>IceWM</title>
    <para>

     Paste these configuration settings into
     <filename>~/.icewm/preferences</filename>:

     <programlisting>
      # Manage root window (EXPERIMENTAL - normally enabled!)

   <title>Running as root</title>
   <para>

    If you run the filer as the `root' user then the filer will display
    a message at the top of each window to remind you. The root user has
    permission to access or change any file in the system, so be very
    careful when using the filer like this.

    Normally, you should log in as an ordinary user and only change to
    root when you need to. If you have <command>sudo</command> installed
    and set up then you can run the filer like this:

    <screen>$ sudo rox</screen>

    Remember, any file operations you perform and any programs you run from
    these windows will run as root too! Be careful!
    </para><para>
    You may find that the X server won't allow root (or other users) to
    connect. Reading the manual pages for <command>xauth</command> and
    <command>xhost</command> may give you some hints, but it varies
    between systems (which is why this isn't built in to the filer!).

   </para>
   
   <para>
    Note: <command>gnomesu</command> can also be used to run the filer as root,
    but you'll need to use <command>setsid</command> to run it in a new
    session group, otherwise gnomesu kills it before it has a chance to open
    a window. For example:
    <screen>gnomesu -c 'setsid /usr/local/bin/rox /'</screen>

   If you have user-defineable key-bindings enabled, then other keys can easily
   be set by opening the menu, moving the pointer over the item you want to use
   and pressing a key. The key will appear in the menu and can be used from

     Permissions
    </title>
    <para>

     The permissions field, when shown, is made up of four groups of three
     flags. Each flag is displayed as a letter if it is on and a dash (&ndash;)
     if not. The first three characters show the permissions for the owner
     of the file, the second for other members of the file's group and
     the third for everyone else. Whichever group applies to the
     <application>ROX-Filer</application> process itself is shown underlined.
     The fourth group shows any special flags.
     </para><para>
     The meanings of the characters are:

     <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>r</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Permission to read the contents of a file, or the names of files
        in a directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>w</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Permission to alter the contents of a file, or change which names
        appear in a directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>x</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Permission to run the file as a program, or refer to the files
        listed within the directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>U</computeroutput> &mdash;
        This program executes with the <emphasis>effective user ID</emphasis> of its
        owner rather than the person who ran it.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>G</computeroutput> &mdash;
        This program executes with the <emphasis>effective group ID</emphasis> of its
        group, regardless of who ran it.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>T</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Entries in this directory can only be altered or removed by the
        people who own the files even if they have write permission on the
        directory itself.</para></listitem>

     </itemizedlist>
     For example,
     <programlisting>
      <emphasis role="underline">rwx</emphasis>,rwx,r-x/---</programlisting>
     means that the owner of the file is the same as the effective user of
     <application>ROX-Filer</application> (basically, you own the file), you and
     members of the file's group have read, write and execute permission and other
     people have only read and execute permission. There are no special flags set.

     The rules which determine which permissions apply may vary slightly between
     operating systems, but a rough guide is:

     <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>If the <emphasis>effective user ID</emphasis> of the
        process is equal to the file's owner, then the owner permissions apply.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Otherwise, if the <emphasis>effective group ID</emphasis>
        of the process is equal to the file's group OR the file's group is one
        of the process's <emphasis>supplemental groups</emphasis> then the
        group permissions apply.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Otherwise, the `other' permissions apply. The
        <emphasis>real user ID</emphasis> and <emphasis>real group
         ID</emphasis> have no effect (except that a process may set its real
        IDs to its effective IDs).
      </para></listitem>

     </itemizedlist>

    </para>

  <sect1>
   <title>The file menu</title>
   <para>
    All of these work in the same way &mdash; if you open the menu with some
    items selected then the operation applies to those items. If you open
    then menu over an item while there is no selection then that item
    is temporarily selected.
    </para><para>
    If you choose one of these while there is no selection at all then the
    window goes into `target mode'; the operation happens to the next item you
    click on. Click on the window background, press <keycap>Escape</keycap>, or
    click with the right mouse button to cancel target mode. Target mode is
    mainly useful with the <guilabel>Single-click navigation</guilabel> option
    and keys bound to the various menu entries. </para><para>
    Note that individual applications may add extra menu items to the
    top of this submenu when you click over them &mdash; see
    <xref linkend="AppDir"/> for details. There may also be any number of
    user-defined actions at the top, which depend on the type of file
    clicked on. You can add programs here by choosing the
    <guimenuitem>Customise Menu</guimenuitem> item. For example, you could
    make <application>The Gimp</application> appear on the menu for images, and
    <application>FreeFS</application> appear for mount points.

   <formalpara><title>Note about symlinks:</title>
    <para>
     A symbolic link stores the <emphasis>location</emphasis>
     of another file. Deleting the symlink doesn't affect the other file.
     Deleting the other file means that the symlink won't work. There are
     two types of symbolic link &mdash; Relative and Absolute. An absolute
     link stores the path from the root directory to the target file (eg
     <filename>/home/fred/MyFile</filename>).

     A relative path stores the path from the symlink
     to the target (eg <filename>../fred/MyFile</filename>).
     If the target file is never going to move then you want an absolute link,
     but if the target may move (and the symlink will be moved with it) then
     you want a relative link.

    Each entry in this submenu opens a savebox for creating a new file or

    To add your own entries, choose <guimenuitem>Customise Menu</guimenuitem>
    and put any files you want in there. Each file in the directory will appear
    on the menu and the box that appears will copy it. For example, you could
    create a blank HTML file:

    <programlisting>
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Page&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  The contents.
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

    Save this as <filename>index.html</filename> inside the
    <filename>Templates</filename> directory and you can easily create new
    HTML files. You can also save blank documents from various applications
    into here (eg, a blank spreadsheet, a blank letter, etc).

    The `Send To' menu provides a quick way to send some files to an application.
    The filer scans all the <filename>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/rox.sourceforge.net/SendTo</filename>
    directories (see <citation>BaseDir</citation>) and lists
    the contents on this menu.

    them in and choosing <guimenuitem>Link</guimenuitem> from the menu.
    </para><para>
    Opening the Send To menu via the main menu is rather slow, so it is

   icons and you can right-click on one to see the popup menu.
   </para><para>
   Drag panel icons with the middle mouse button to move them around.
   In previous versions of the filer, pinboard icons were also moved using the
   middle mouse button, but this is no longer supported (as the middle button
   is reserved for the window manager's use).
   </para><para>
   You can assign keyboard shortcuts to pinboard and panel icons. These can be
   used to open directories, files or applications quickly, even if another
   window has the focus.
   </para><para>
   Changes to the pinboard and panel are automatically saved. Clicking on pinned

    Pinning a file does <emphasis>not</emphasis> copy it, it merely
    creates a shortcut to the original file. If you delete the file, then

   <anchor id="media" xreflabel="Removable devices"/>Removable devices
  </title>
  <para>
   Using removable devices, such as floppy disks and CDROMs under ROX-Filer is quite
   simple. However, it is important to understand about <emphasis>mounting</emphasis> and
   <emphasis>unmounting</emphasis> devices.
  </para>
  <para>
   Mounting a device causes its contents to appear in the filesystem. On a typical setup,
   the directory <filename>/floppy</filename> is an empty directory on the hard disk.
   The floppy device is then mounted onto this directory, causing its contents to appear
   inside. For example, a file called <filename>Letter</filename> on the floppy disk will
   appear as <filename>/floppy/Letter</filename>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Devices must be unmounted before the disk is removed. Unmounting causes the system to
   write any buffered data to the disk. If you remove a disk without unmounting
   it, it will probably be corrupted. CD and Zip drives often lock the tray while the
   device is mounted so you can't remove it accidentally.
  </para>
  <para>
   So that you don't have to specify which device should be mounted at which point in the
   filesystem every time you want to use a disk, a preset list is usually found in the
   file <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. ROX-Filer shows mount points (such as
   <filename>/floppy</filename>) which are listed here but not mounted with transparent
   grey circles overlayed on their icons.
  </para>
  <para>
   Clicking on one of these mount points will mount the device for you. The circle turns
   green to indicate that the device is now mounted. Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> remove
   the device while the circle is lit! You can unmount the device by clicking
   while holding down <keycap>Shift</keycap> on the <filename>/floppy</filename>
   directory icon.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can also unmount a device by closing its directory window (eg, closing
   the view of <filename>/floppy</filename>) and choosing Unmount when prompted. The
   filer will only offer to unmount devices this way if they were mounted by
   the filer in the first place.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you want to open a directory without mounting anything (eg, if you want to
   see the contents of <filename>/floppy</filename> on the hard disk), you can
   click on the unmounted mount point with <keycap>Shift</keycap> held down.
   This isn't usually useful, as these directories are typically empty.
  </para>

 <chapter>
  <title><anchor id="thumbnails" xreflabel="Thumbnails"/>File thumbnails</title>
  <para>
    When thumbnailing is turned on, the filer tries to load every image file
    and use that image as the file's icon. Useful if you have a directory full
    of photos and can't remember which is which! You can turn it on for
    a single directory by choosing <guimenuitem>Show Thumbnails</guimenuitem>
    from the <guimenu>Display</guimenu> menu. You can set it as the default
    from the Options box.
    The titlebar shows <guilabel>(Thumbs)</guilabel> when thumbnailing is on.
  </para>
  <para>
    The thumbnails are saved in <filename>~/.thumbnails</filename> for
    quick loading next time.
    While loading thumbnails, a progress bar appears at the bottom of
    the window. Clicking on the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button
    beside the bar stops the scan.
    It is also possible to thumbnail other types of file, such as videos
    (eg, by showing the first frame), with a suitable helper program.
  </para>
  <sect1><title>Technical details</title>
  <para>
When in thumbnail mode <application>ROX-Filer</application> checks the
thumbnail directory (<filename>~/.thumbs/normal</filename>) for a
thumbnail for each file it scans. If a thumbnail exists it loads it and
continues on to the next file.
  </para><para>
To generate a thumbnail for a given file of type media/subtype the filer looks
for a program <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/MIME-thumb/media_subtype</filename>,
falling back to <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/MIME-thumb/media</filename> if one
cannot be found (this duplicates how run actions for files are looked up). If
neither file can be found and the file is of type image/* then the internal
routines are used. If the file is not of type image/* then no thumbnail is
generated.
  </para><para>
If the generator program is found, is executed with the parameters
<screen>thumbnailer /path/to/source/file /path/to/thumbnail pixel_size</screen>
  </para><para>
Once the child program exits, it attempts to load
<filename>/path/to/thumbnail</filename>. If that fails no thumbnail is
displayed.
  </para><para>
Note that because of the order it does things ROX-Filer will happily
use any pre-existing thumbnail even if it has no idea how it was
generated.

   <anchor id="bulkrename" xreflabel="The Bulk Rename window"/>Renaming files in bulk
  </title>
  <para>
   If you have a large number of files to rename, it is tedious to rename them one
   by one. Instead, select all the files and choose <guimenuitem>Rename...</guimenuitem>
   from the menu to open the bulk rename window.
  </para>

  <para>
   The window shows a table with two columns. The <guilabel>Old name</guilabel> column
   shows the current name of each selected file, and the <guilabel>New name</guilabel>
   column shows the new name, which is initially the same.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are two ways to change the new names. You can edit the names in the table
   directly, or you can use the search and replace feature at the top of the window.
   This takes a regular expression to search for, and some text to replace matches
   with. For example, if you had a lot of files with names ending in
   <filename>.htm</filename> and you wanted to change them to use
   <filename>.html</filename>, you would enter <userinput>\.htm$</userinput> in
   the <guilabel>Replace:</guilabel> field and <userinput>.html</userinput> in the
   <guilabel>With:</guilabel> field. When you click <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>, the
   table is updated to show the proposed new names (but no actual renaming is done
   yet).
  </para>

  <para>
   Having checked that the new names look OK, click on the <guibutton>Rename</guibutton>
   button to actually perform the rename operation.
  </para>

 <chapter id="actions">
  <title>Action windows</title>
  <para>
   Action windows are those boxes that appear while you're doing a
   Copy/Move/Link/etc operation. The status line at the top of the window shows
   the current directory or object that the window is processing. The scrolling
   area below is the log area &mdash; it shows what has been done, and questions
   may be displayed here.
   </para><para>
   Below this are four buttons and some options. All windows have the
   <guilabel>Quiet</guilabel> option. When this is on the filer will only
   confirm some operations (such as deleting a non-writeable file). Otherwise,
   all operations are confirmed.
   </para><para>
   The buttons work as follows:

   <variablelist>

    <varlistentry><term><guibutton>Yes</guibutton></term><listitem><para>
       answers yes to the question displayed in the log area.

    </para></listitem></varlistentry>


   </variablelist>

   You can control which actions get started automatically (without you
   having to click on <guibutton>Quiet</guibutton> at the start) from the
   Options window.
  </para>

  <sect1>
   <title>Action window options</title>
   <para>

    Some actions have options, which appear as option boxes at the bottom
    of the window. They are:

    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem><para>
       <guilabel>Force</guilabel> means that the filer won't treat non-writeable
       files as special.  Normally, it confirms the deletion even if
       <guibutton>Quiet</guibutton> is pressed.
       Note that you still can't remove files from non-writeable directories because
       in that case you really don't have permission.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <guilabel>Brief</guilabel> prevents the filer logging a message every time it
       does something.  Use this to speed things up if large numbers of messages are
       being logged.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <guilabel>Recurse</guilabel> means that doing something to a directory will
       also do the same thing to all its contents, and the contents of any
       subdirectories, and so on.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <guilabel>Newer</guilabel> will automatically copy a file over an existing one
       if the file is newer than the one it replaces (later modification time).
     </para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
     You can set the defaults for these options from the Options box.

 <chapter id="searching">
  <title><anchor id="Searching" xreflabel="Searching"/>Searching</title>
  <para>
   The Find feature looks through all the selected files and directories
   and any subdirectories (recursively) looking for items that match
   a particular expression.
   </para><para>
   Choose <guimenuitem>Find</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>File</guimenu>
   submenu to search all the selected objects. If you want to select all the
   files within a single directory which meet certain criteria, use
   <guimenuitem>Select</guimenuitem> -> <guimenuitem>Select If...</guimenuitem>
   instead.
   </para><para>
   If you know the name of a file then just enter it in the `Expression:'
   box, enclosed in single quotes. For example, to find a file called
   <filename>log</filename> you would enter <userinput>'log'</userinput>.

   Remember to use normal quotes, not double quotes (") or back-quotes (`).
   </para><para>
   As the filer finds matching files they are added to the results list.
   Double-clicking on an entry in the list opens a viewer showing that file.
   The filer will use the same window to view other results (so, if you want
   the results shown in separate windows you must explicitly create a new
   window from the <guimenu>Window</guimenu> menu).
  </para>

  <sect1>
   <title>Wildcards</title>
   <para>

    You can also put shell-style wildcard characters inside the quotes,
    for example:

    <simplelist>

     <member><command>'*.html'</command></member>
     <member><command>'Report.*'</command></member>
     <member><command>'Draft[1-5]'</command></member>
     <member><command>'main.[ch]'</command></member>

    </simplelist>

    Look at the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>glob</refentrytitle>
     <manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    manpage if you want to know more about shell wildcards.
    </para><para>
    If the pattern you enter contains a slash (`/') character then the
    pattern is matched against the file's full path, otherwise only the
    leafname is used. That is, <userinput>'*tmp*'</userinput> will find
    <filename>tmp</filename> and <filename>tmpfile</filename> but not
    <filename>/tmp/file</filename> &mdash; <userinput>'/*tmp*'</userinput> will find
    all three.
   </para>

   <title>Simple tests</title>
   <para>
    As well as finding files by their names you can also find them by
    various other attributes. Note that <emphasis>file</emphasis> is used here to
    mean anything that can appear in the filesystem &mdash; including directories,
    devices and so on.
    </para><para>
    You can also use a short form for each test; these are shown in brackets.
    You can combine multiple tests &mdash; `<userinput>-rw</userinput>' is
    the same as `<userinput>IsReadable and IsWriteable</userinput>'.

  <sect1>
   <title>Logic operators</title>
   <para>
    You can combine the above tests in various ways to perform more advanced
    searches.
    An expression is actually made up of a list of <emphasis>cases</emphasis>,
    separated by commas. The filer will try to match each case in turn
    until one matches or there are no more cases left. For example, to
    search for files with several possible endings:

    <screen>'*.gif', '*.htm', '*.html'</screen>

    Further, each of the cases is actually a list of conditions. The case
    only matches if all of its conditions are met. So, to find a directory
    called <filename>lib</filename> or a regular file ending in
    <filename>.so</filename>:

    <screen>IsDir 'lib', IsReg '*.so'</screen>

    You can negate a condition by putting a <userinput>!</userinput> in front
    of it and you can use a sub-expression as a condition by bracketing it,
    like this:

    <screen>
     !(IsDir, IsReg)

     !IsDir !IsReg

     Not isdir and not isreg

     !-d !-f</screen>
    All four do the same thing.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Comparisons</title>
   <para>
    You can also compare various values using the operators
    <userinput>&lt;</userinput>,
    <userinput>&lt;=</userinput>,
    <userinput>=</userinput>,
    <userinput>!=</userinput>,
    <userinput>&gt;</userinput>, and
    <userinput>&gt;=</userinput>
    (for less-than, less-than-or-equal-to, equal-to,
    not-equal-to, greater-than and greater-than-or-equal-to).

    When comparing times, you may find it helpful to use
    <userinput>after</userinput> and <userinput>before</userinput> instead of
    <userinput>&gt;</userinput> and <userinput>&lt;</userinput> to make things
    clearer.
   </para>

    Times are measured as seconds since the Unix Epoch (00:00:00 UTC,
    January 1, 1970). Sizes are in bytes. When specifying constants to
    compare these values with you may use various keywords to scale the
    value:

    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Byte(s)</userinput> has no effect, but looks better.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Kb</userinput> multiplies by 1024, so 2Kb is the same as 2048.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Mb</userinput> multiplies by 1024<superscript>2</superscript>,
       ie 1024 Kb.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Sec(s)</userinput> has no effect, but looks nice.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Min(s)</userinput> multiplies by 60 to get minutes.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Hour(s), Day(s), Week(s), Year(s)</userinput> likewise
       convert to the relevant unit.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Ago</userinput> makes the time in the past relative to when
       the check is done.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Hence</userinput> makes the time in the future.
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>Now</userinput> is short for <userinput>0 Secs Hence</userinput>.
     </para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    Some examples should make this all a bit clearer!

    <screen>
     mtime after 1 day ago

     size &gt; 10 Mb

     IsReg and nlinks &gt; 1</screen>
    The first finds files modified within the last 24 hours. You could
    use <userinput>&gt;</userinput> instead of <userinput>after</userinput>,
    but it's not so clear what is meant.
    </para><para>
    The second finds files larger than 10 Mb. The last finds regular files with
    more than one directory entry.
    </para><para>
    Be careful though &mdash; the filer doesn't check the context of the
    modifiers, so <userinput>size &gt; 1 day ago</userinput> is allowed,
    although it doesn't make much sense!

    Also, forgetting to use <userinput>ago</userinput> or
    <userinput>hence</userinput> will cause odd effects (the time will be
    measured relative to the Epoch rather than the current time).
    Finally, don't use <userinput>=</userinput> with times &mdash;
    <userinput>atime = 1 day ago</userinput> looks for a file accessed
    <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> 86400 seconds ago...

   </para>

   <para>

    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem><para>
       <userinput>System(Command)</userinput> executes `Command' on the file.
       The test succeeds if the command returns an exit status of zero. A `%'
       character in `Command' is replaced by the full path of the file being
       checked.  <userinput>System</userinput> is a very slow test to perform,
       so do it last if possible.  For example, if you're looking for a
       <filename>.c</filename> file containing the word `main', do:

       <screen>'*.c' system(grep -q main "%")</screen>
       so that the grep is only performed for files ending in <filename>.c</filename>
       (as opposed to only checking that the file ends in <filename>.c</filename> if
       it contains the word `main').
     </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>

       </citerefentry> command.</para></footnote>

       However, if it gets evaluated at all then it prevents the filer
       from checking inside the current directory. Remember the order in which
       the filer checks the expression!
     </para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    Examples:

    <screen>
     '*.old' system(rm '%')

     'src' prune, '*.c'</screen>
    The first deletes each file ending in <filename>.old</filename>.
    The second looks for <filename>.c</filename> files, but does not bother
    checking inside directories called <filename>src</filename>.
    The expression is evaluated like this:
    </para><para>
    If file is named <filename>src</filename> then `Prune'.
    Either way, check if it ends in <filename>.c</filename> and include
    it in the results if so.

   <para>
    This box appears when you choose <guimenuitem>Set Run Action...</guimenuitem>
    from the File menu, and is used to set which application is loaded when you click
    on a file.
    </para><para>
    For example, let's say you want to set things up so that opening a
    <filename>.gif</filename> file loads it into the Gimp.
    First, right-click over a gif image to open the menu and choose
    <guimenuitem>Set Run Action...</guimenuitem> from the
    <guimenuitem>File</guimenuitem> submenu.
    Then, you have a choice of two methods to set the run action:
   </para>

   <sect2><title>Setting the run action by drag-and-drop</title>
    <para>
     Drag the Gimp (from a filer window, a panel or the pinboard) onto
     the area marked <guilabel>Drop a suitable application here</guilabel>.
     From now on, clicking on a GIF file will load it into the Gimp.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2><title>Setting the run action by entering a shell command</title>
    <para>
     Type: <userinput>gimp "$@"</userinput>
     into the box labelled <guilabel>Enter a shell command</guilabel> and press
     <keycap>Return</keycap>. <userinput>$@</userinput>
     will be replaced by the name of the file you click on when this command
     is used. As before, clicking on any GIF image will now load it into
     the Gimp.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2><title>Setting the default media-type handlers</title>
    <para>
     Whichever method you use to set the action you have the choice of
     setting the run action just for that type, or setting the default
     for all files with that media-type which don't already have a specific
     action.
     </para><para>
     Since the Gimp can load many types of image, it makes sense
     to select the <guilabel>Set default for all `image/&lt;anything&gt;'</guilabel>
     option so you don't have to do it again for image/jpeg files and so on. However,
     this only affects types that don't already have a specific action
     (ie, those that would have brought up an error box if you tried to
     open them).
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

   <title><anchor id="SetIcon" xreflabel="the Set Icon box"/>
    The Set Icon box
   </title>
   <para>

    This box appears when you choose <guimenuitem>Set Icon...</guimenuitem>
    from the File menu, and is used to set which image to use to represent
    the file.
    </para><para>
    It works much like the Set Run Action box described above, except that
    you may specifiy an icon for one file individually (by name) as well as
    for all files of a particular type. When setting the icon for a single
    file, the filer stores the name of the file and the name of the icon inside
    your <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/MIME-icons</filename>
    directory. If either moves, the icon won't be displayed.
    </para><para>
    When setting the icon for a directory, you have the additional option of
    storing the image inside the directory itself as a hidden file. This means
    that other users will see the icon too, and you can safely delete the original
    image after the copy (note that the image is scaled down if needed, and converted
    to PNG format).
    </para><para>
    The directory icon inside the <guilabel>Drop an icon here</guilabel>
    area allows you to quickly get to a directory from which you are already
    using one or more icons.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>How filetypes are stored</title>
   <para>

    <application>ROX-Filer</application> uses two sub-directories in your
    <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net</filename> directory for filetypes:

    <variablelist>

     <varlistentry><term><filename>MIME-types</filename></term><listitem><para>
        contains symlinks, one for each MIME type, which point
        to programs that can handle files of that type. To set what program
        is run when you click on the file you should normally use the <guimenuitem>Set
         Run Action...</guimenuitem> feature (see the <xref linkend="RunAction"/> section).
        However, you can also set the actions manually &mdash; for example, to make
        opening an HTML file load it into Netscape:

        <orderedlist>
         <listitem><para>
           Find the Netscape application and go to <guimenuitem>Link...</guimenuitem>
           on the menu.
         </para></listitem>

         <listitem><para>
           Enter <userinput>text_html</userinput> as the name for the link and drag the
           icon from the Link box into the <filename>MIME-types</filename> directory.
         </para></listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        You can also put actual programs in here as well as links if you want
        to.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><filename>MIME-icons</filename></term><listitem><para>
        contains the images used to display each type of file.
        So the filer will try to display an HTML file using the icon
        <filename>MIME-icons/text_html.png</filename>. If no icon is set here,
	the filer will use the currently selected icon theme (as set in the options
	box); see <citation>IconTheme</citation> for details.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    In <filename>MIME-types</filename> you can also provide default actions for each media type.
    For example, if <filename>text_html</filename> isn't found then the filer
    will try simply using <filename>text</filename>.
   </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>How the filer determines a file's type</title>
   <para>
    The filer usually works out the type for a file from its name. If this fails,
    it tries to guess from the file's contents. It is possible to override this guessing
    by setting an extended attribute on the file with the correct type, using the
    <guimenuitem>Set Type...</guimenuitem> menu item.
   </para>
   <para>
    To edit the rules used to guess types, open the options box and go to the Types section.
    There is a button there that will launch the MIME-Editor application.
    You can also edit the rules manually &mdash; see <citation>SharedMIME</citation> for details.

   Application directories
  </title>
  <para>
   An application directory is a directory which can be run as an application.
   It contains all the resources of an application &mdash; source code, binaries,
   documentation and so on. Keeping everything in one place make installation
   and uninstallation much easier for users. You can also keep multiple
   versions of a program by simply having several application directories.
   You may move and rename them as you please. Application directories
   make programs easier to use and install.
   </para><para>
   They're more secure too, because you can compile an application as a user and
   then simply copy it as root. Since you don't have to run an install script
   you are free from the danger of running untrusted code as root. All you have
   to watch out for is setuid binaries.

   <title>Creating and applying patches</title>
   <para>
    When people make small modifications to the sources they will often
    distribute them as <emphasis>patch files</emphasis> &mdash; usually on the
    mailing list.

    To apply a patch, go into the <filename>src</filename> directory and run
    <command>patch</command> with the patch file. Then recompile, like this:

    <screen>
     $ cd ROX-Filer/src

    You can remove the patch by simply repeating the above sequence &mdash;
    <command>patch</command> will detect that the patch is already applied
    and offer to remove it.
    </para><para>
    To create a patch you should first get the latest version of the filer
    from CVS (instructions on using CVS can be found on the web-site).
    Modify the program as you please. Create the patch using
    <command>cvs diff</command> from the appropriate directory:

    <screen>$ cvs diff -u &gt; my_patch</screen>

    This creates a human&ndash; and machine-readable patch file. Submit this
    to the mailing list. The are many reasons for posting patches rather

 <appendix id="soap"><title>SOAP RPC</title>

  <para>When the filer starts you can use command-line options to control its behaviour.
   As an alternative to this, the filer allows you to specify an operation with a
   <citation>SOAP</citation> RPC format message. In fact, if you use the command-line options,
   the filer converts to SOAP RPC internally.
  </para>

  <para>All SOAP RPC messages are passed on standard input, like this:

   <screen>
$ rox --RPC &lt;&lt; EOF
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"&gt;
 &lt;env:Body xmlns="http://rox.sourceforge.net/SOAP/ROX-Filer"&gt;
  &lt;Panel&gt;
   &lt;Name&gt;Default&lt;/Name&gt;
   &lt;Side&gt;Bottom&lt;/Side&gt;
  &lt;/Panel&gt;
 &lt;/env:Body&gt;
&lt;/env:Envelope&gt;
EOF</screen>

   The following methods are recognised:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

   <listitem><para><function>Version</function>()
     Returns the filer's version.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>CloseDir</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Close directory <parameter>Filename</parameter> and all its subdirectories.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Examine</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     <parameter>Filename</parameter> may have changed &mdash; check it and
     update the display.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>OpenDir</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>,
     [<parameter>Style</parameter>, <parameter>Details</parameter>, <parameter>Sort</parameter>,
     <parameter>Class</parameter>, <parameter>ID</parameter>,
     <parameter>Hidden</parameter>, <parameter>Filter</parameter>])
     Open a window showing directory <parameter>Filename</parameter>.
     <parameter>Style</parameter> is one of <userinput>Large</userinput>, <userinput>Small</userinput>, <userinput>Huge</userinput>
     or <userinput>Automatic</userinput>.
     <parameter>Details</parameter> is one of <userinput>None</userinput>, <userinput>ListView</userinput>, <userinput>Size</userinput>, <userinput>Type</userinput>, <userinput>Times</userinput> or <userinput>Permissions</userinput>.
     <parameter>Sort</parameter> is one of <userinput>Name</userinput>, <userinput>Type</userinput>, <userinput>Date</userinput>, <userinput>Size</userinput>,
<userinput>Owner</userinput> or <userinput>Group</userinput>.
     If any of these three option parameters are missing, the default is used.
     <parameter>Class</parameter> can be used to set the WM_CLASS property on the new window. You can
     use this to get your window manager to treat the window
specially.
     <parameter>ID</parameter> is a string used to identify the 
opened window. If a window with this ID already exists, it is changed to the
given directory. Otherwise, a new window is created and given this ID.
If used from a program, ensure the IDs you generate are unique, for example
by including your process name, PID and a timestamp in the ID.
<parameter>Hidden</parameter> if <userinput>true</userinput> means
that hidden files (those that start with a dot character) are shown,
or not shown if <userinput>false</userinput>.  If ommitted then the 
configured setting is used.
<parameter>Filter</parameter> can be used to filter files shown by
their name.  For example using a filter of <userinput>*.c</userinput>
means that only files ending in .c are shown.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Panel</function>([<parameter>Side</parameter>,
     <parameter>Name</parameter>])
     Open the panel named <parameter>Name</parameter> on screen side
     <parameter>Side</parameter> (<userinput>Top</userinput>|<userinput>Bottom</userinput>|<userinput>Left</userinput>|<userinput>Right</userinput>).
     <parameter>Name</parameter> can be a name in <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Filer</filename>
     (eg, <userinput>MyPanel</userinput>) or a full pathname.
     If not given, the panel on that side is turned off.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>PanelAdd</function>(<parameter>Side</parameter>,
     <parameter>Path</parameter>, [<parameter>Label</parameter>,
     <parameter>After</parameter>, <parameter>Shortcut</parameter>, <parameter>Args</parameter>])
     Add <parameter>Path</parameter> to the panel on side <parameter>Side</parameter>,
     with label <parameter>Label</parameter>. If <parameter>After</parameter> is
     <userinput>true</userinput> the icon goes on the right/bottom side of the panel,
     otherwise on the left/top side.  If <parameter>Shortcut</parameter>
is given it is the keyboard shortcut to trigger this item.  If
<parameter>Args</parameter> is given it is the argument string to
append to the item when run if it is a program.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>PanelRemove</function>(<parameter>Side</parameter>,
     [<parameter>Path</parameter>, <parameter>Label</parameter>])
     Remove an item from the panel on side <parameter>Side</parameter>. If
     <parameter>Path</parameter> or <parameter>Label</parameter> is not given
     then any path or label will match. At least one must be specified.
     If more than one item matches, only one is removed.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Pinboard</function>([<parameter>Name</parameter>])
     Display pinboard <parameter>Name</parameter> on the desktop background.
     <parameter>Name</parameter> can be a name in  <filename>~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Filer</filename>
     (eg, <userinput>MyPinboard</userinput>) or a full pathname.
     If not given, the pinboard is turned off.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>PinboardAdd</function>(<parameter>Path</parameter>,
     [<parameter>X</parameter>, <parameter>Y</parameter>,
<parameter>Label</parameter>, <parameter>Shortcut</parameter>, <parameter>Args</parameter>, <parameter>Update</parameter>])
     Add <parameter>Path</parameter> to the pinboard with the (optional) 
     label <parameter>Label</parameter>. If X or Y are negative or not given, 
     the icon is placed automatically. The X and Y parameters then indicate 
     where the icon should go (X=-1: left, X=-2: right, Y=-1: top, Y=-2: 
     bottom). If X and Y are given, its position is (<parameter>X</parameter>, 
     <parameter>Y</parameter>). If <parameter>Shortcut</parameter> is given it 
     is the keyboard shortcut to trigger this item.  If 
     <parameter>Args</parameter> is given it is the argument string to append 
     to the item when run if it is a program. If <parameter>Update</parameter> 
     is true and there is already an icon for the given path on the pinboard, 
     the new values will be filled in instead of adding a new icon.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>PinboardRemove</function>(<parameter>Path</parameter>, [<parameter>Label</parameter>])
     Remove <parameter>Path</parameter> from the pinboard. If <parameter>Label</parameter> is given
then this must match the label of the item.  If more than one item matches, only one is removed.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>SetBackdropApp</function>(<parameter>App</parameter>)
     Make <parameter>App</parameter> (an application directory) the new handler
     for the current pinboard's backdrop.
     The <filename>AppInfo.xml</filename> file inside <parameter>App</parameter>
     must contain the CanSetBackdrop element, eg:
     <programlisting>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;AppInfo&gt;
      &lt;ROX:CanSetBackdrop xmlns:ROX="http://rox.sourceforge.net/SOAP/ROX-Filer"/>
&lt;/AppInfo&gt;</programlisting>
     The application will be run with the <option>--backdrop</option> option
     as it's only argument after invoking this method, and whenever the pinboard is
     reloaded. DO NOT use this method if invoked with <option>--backdrop</option> or
     you will get stuck in an infinite loop!
     See <xref linkend="backdropapp"/> for a guide to writing backdrop applications.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>SetBackdrop</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>,
   <parameter>Style</parameter>)
   Set the backdrop image to a given file. If you want to regenerate the image next
   time the user logs in, or you want to change it automatically from time to time,
   use <function>SetBackdropApp</function> above instead.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Run</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Run <parameter>Filename</parameter> as if it was clicked on in the filer.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>RunURI</function>(<parameter>URI</parameter>)
     Run <parameter>URI</parameter> as if it was clicked on in the filer.
     <parameter>URI</parameter> is interpreted as a URI, in the form
     file://localhost/path.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Show</function>(<parameter>Directory</parameter>,
     <parameter>Leafname</parameter>)
     Open <parameter>Directory</parameter> and flash the file
     <parameter>Leafname</parameter> inside it.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>FileType</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Returns the MIME-type of <parameter>Filename</parameter> (by writing the
     SOAP response to standard output).
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>SetIcon</function>(<parameter>Path</parameter>,
   <parameter>Icon</parameter>)
     Set the icon to use for the given path. This is equivalent to using the
     <guimenuitem>Set Icon...</guimenuitem> menu item.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>UnsetIcon</function>(<parameter>Path</parameter>)
     Clear the icon to use for the given path.
   </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   The following calls can be used to start new file actions.
   <parameter>Quiet</parameter> can be <userinput>true</userinput> if the
   operation should start immediately, instead of waiting for the user to
   confirm. If <userinput>false</userinput>, the user must always confirm. If
   not given, the default setting is used.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><function>Copy</function>(<parameter>From</parameter>,
     <parameter>To</parameter>, [<parameter>Leafname</parameter>,
     <parameter>Quiet</parameter>])
     Copy each file in the array <parameter>From</parameter> to the directory
     <parameter>To</parameter>. If <parameter>Leafname</parameter> is given
     then <parameter>From</parameter> should contain a single entry only;
     <parameter>Leafname </parameter> gives the new leafname.
   </para></listitem>
