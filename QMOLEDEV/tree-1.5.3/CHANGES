Version 1.5.3
  - Properly quote directories for the system command when tree is relaunched
    using the -R option.
  - Fixed possible indentation problem if dirs[*] is not properly zeroed
    (Martin Nagy).
  - Use strcoll() instead of strcmp() to sort files based on locale if set.
  - Change "const static" to "static const" to remove some compiler warnings
    for Solaris (Kamaraju Kusumanchi).
  - Actually use TREE_CHARSET if it's defined.
  - Automatically select UTF-8 charset if TREE_CHARSET is not set, and the
    locale is set to *UTF-8 (overridden with --charset option.)

Version 1.5.2.2
  - Set locale before checking MB_CUR_MAX.
  - Added HP-NonStop platform support (Craig McDaniel <craigmcd@gmail.com>)
  - Fixed to support 32 bit UID/GIDs.
  - Added Solaris build options to Makefile (edit and uncomment to use).

Version 1.5.2.1
  - Added strverscmp.c file for os's without strverscmp.  Source file is
    attributed to: Jean-Franois Bignolles <bignolle@ecoledoc.ibp.fr>
  - Try different approach to MB_CUR_MAX problem.
  - Changed the argument to printit() to be signed char to avoid warnings.

Version 1.5.2
  - Added --filelimit X option to not descend directories that have more than
    X number of files in them.
  - Added -v option for version sorting (also called natural sorting) ala ls.

Version 1.5.1.2
  - Fixed compile issues related to MB_CUR_MAX on non-linux machines.
  - Removed unecessary features.h

Version 1.5.1.1
  - Regression in HTML output, fixed formatting issues.

Version 1.5.1
  - Remove extraneous / at end of user input directory names when using -f
    option (Zurd)
  - List available charsets if --charset option is missing charset argument.
  - Fixed --charset option processing bug.
  - Fixed missing <br>'s when -i option used with -H.
  - Added -h option for human readable output.
  - Colorization bugfix for special files and directories (make tree behave as
    ls does)

Version 1.5.0
  - Added -T option to change title and H1 header in HTML output.
  - Added -r option to reverse alpha sort output, ala. 'ls -r'.
  - '|' wildcard support added by David MacMahon <davidm@astron.Berkeley.EDU>.
  - Remove extraneous '/' at the end of dirs and dir-symlinks in HTML output.
  - Removed several possible overflow problems by dynamically allocating
    arrays in several places.
  - Better support for Locales and printing utf-8 encoded characters in
    filenames (still hackish).
  - Fixed -t to alphasort files with same time-stamps.
  - Fixed encoding of filenames in HTML output, Kyosuke and others.
  - Patches by Kyosuke Tokoro <NBG01720@nifty.ne.jp>:
    - Now, runs OS/2 systems.
      + Print the file attributes in 'adhrs' format for each file, instead
        of the protections in 'drwxrwxrwx' format, when running the tree
        on OS/2 with option -p.
    - Added --charset option, to specify which character set is used for
      output.
       + You can specify any IANA registered character set name. But I have
         tested only following character sets:
               Shift_JIS       EUC-JP          IBM850
               UTF-8           ISO-8859-1      US-ASCII
       + Now, `-S' option is equal to `--charset=IBM437'.
       + When running on OS/2 systems, the default value of this option
         is according to current codepage.  On the other systems, no default.
  - Change font-weight to font-size in CSS .VERSION.
  - Change version to standard major.minor.patch format.
  - Switch from artistic license to GPLv2.

Version 1.4
  - Added large file support under Linux.
  - Fixed crashing on missing command line arguments.
  - Fixed several memory leaks
  - Added --dirsfirst option to list directories first.
  - Fixed formatting error when unable to open directories.
  - Fixed bug in parse_dir_colors().
  - Changed -I to also ignore directories.
  - Added --nolinks command to turn off hyperlinks with the HTML output.
  - Fixed several memory leaks in listdir().
  - Some additional code cleanup in listdir().
  - Some systems may define TRUE/FALSE, so don't create the enums for TRUE
    and FALSE if that's the case.
  - Fixed over-allocation bug in read_dir().
  - Added crude beginnings of color output for HTML via CSS (Ted Tiberio
    ttiberio@rochester.rr.com).

  - Fixed recursive symlink detection.
  - Added --inodes and --device options.
  - Added --noreport option.

Version 1.3
  - Fixed long pathname problem by dynamically allocating the path.
  - Added recursive symlink detection.
  - Added --help and --version options.
  - When -C is used and LS_COLORS is undefined, tree uses a default color
    scheme (thus -C always forces color output now).
  - Added -S to show ASCII tree lines (Gerald Scheidl)
  - Made tree more portable (Guido Socher and others)

  Following options curtsey of Francesc Rocher:
  - Added -o <filename> to redirect the output.
  - Added -H <baseHRef> to print the tree in HTML format.
  - Added -L to set the maximum level of directories to print.
  - Added -R to recursively restart the search at the level given by `-L'
    option (adding as well `-o 00Tree.html').

Version 1.2
  - Added -D to print the date of the last modification.
  - Added -t option to sort by last modification time (ala ls -t).
  - Added -I <pattern>, similar to the -P option except tree does not print
    those files which match the pattern.
  - Made tree print non-printable characters in filenames in standard unix
    carrot notation.
  - Added -N option to make tree print filenames without any processing.
  - Added -q option to make tree print non-printable characters in filenames
    as question marks.
  - Added `|' to -F output and made it only print character type after the
    link on sym-links, not on the symlink name itself.
  - Added -u option to display username/uid, and -g option to display group
    name/gid.
  - Fully (pass the salt) implemented dircolors support.

Version 1.1
  - Made some changes to the Makefile to insure proper installation and for
    multi-architecture support and a bug-fix.

  - Added -A option to enable ANSI-lines hack.
  - Added some sanity checks for dircolors support.
  - Added -P <pattern> to list only those files that match the wildcard
    given in <pattern>.
  - Fixed error where relative symbolic links to directories would not be
    followed when the -l option was used.
  - Made uid 0 the same as anyone else (-a was default for uid 0)
  - Added -x directive to stay on one filesystem (ala find -xdev).

Version 1.0
  - The original, a model of perfection...
