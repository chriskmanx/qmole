wmctrl
A command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.

To compile and install the program, run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    (become root)
    make install


After installation you may run "wmctrl -h" to view the documentation.


The program is based on the EWMH specification:

    http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/

Please note that wmctrl only works with window managers which implement
this specification.

I recommend you to check out Zenity, which is an excellent 
tool to integrate the GUI and the command line.
