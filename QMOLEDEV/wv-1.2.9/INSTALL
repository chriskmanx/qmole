1. build system
   ------------

   There is now a new build system based on libtool, automake & autoconf,
   which can be used to build shared libraries. This is known to work with
   autoconf-2.52, automake-1.4-p5 and libtool-1.4. Use ./autogen.sh to create
   the new build system.

   KNOWN ISSUES with the *new* build system

   * In wvware CVS the autogen.sh is non-executable - I'm not sure how to
     fix this. However, a quick "chmod 755 autogen.sh" will fix that.
   * There is a bug in automake-1.5 and automake-1.5b that prevents
     dependency generation with GNUmakefile.am. This bug has been fixed in
     automake-1.5d which is (or was for a while) available from alpha.gnu.org
   * libtool <= 1.4.2 has problems with convenience libraries on darwin.
     If building on darwin / MacOSX, please contact me (<fjf@alinameridon.com>)

2. configuring
   -----------

   It should all work hunky dory with

      ./configure
      make
      make install

   A few sample word files to try out wv are included in the examples dir.

   The primary dependencies are libgsf and glib.

      libgsf  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libgsf/
      glib    http://www.gtk.org/ | http://www.gnome.org/

3. converting images
   -----------------

   You'll want to get libwmf to view embedded WMF images. Again, please use 
   the latest libwmf. By default, libwmf support is disabled - please 
   specify when configuring wv: "--with-libwmf"

   libwmf      http://sourceforge.net/projects/wvware

4. compilation problems
   --------------------

   (a) "make" does nothing except complain
       If for some reason the standard "make" didnt work i.e. if "make" gives
       up without compiling a single thing then try "gmake -f Makefile" 
       instead, this is a for systems with old "make", like Irix for example.

   (b) Can't install libwv from a "make install"
       If install fails due to some systems not allowing installs into user
       dirs, change the INSTALL variable in the Makefiles to the path of the
       included "install-sh". This is the kind of thing that happens on AIX.

   (c) Final link fails with "undefined reference to `uncompress'"
       Now there is one possible problem that i've come across, for some reason
       on my old redhat4.2 system there was a libz.a in /usr/X11R6/lib that
       libwv was linking against rather than the correct one in /usr/lib.

       Specifying "--with-zlib=/usr" ought to fix this.

   (d) Compilation failed on parser.lex
       In this case the problem is probably something I've done wrong in the lex 
       code, im not a great lex head. The only solution for this one that i
       know of is to install flex 2.5.4 or higher, available from ftp.gnu.org.

       Alternatively a good lex person could take a look at my definition of
       myalpha in parser.lex and see if its a portable definition or not.

5. supported platforms
   -------------------

   Ive gotten this to work myself so far on Linux/AIX/Solaris/OSF1 and Windows
   (for windows skip to windows section) and ive heard that irix/hpux/bsd also 
   work, and i had one report that with some magic it works on os/2. One mad
   person ported it to AmigaOS, check the homepage for a link to that insanity.
   And there was a few mails from someone who said he had it working under VMS,
   i don't have any patches for that one yet though.

6. libwv for Windows
   -----------------

   It should be possible to compile libwv with the cygwin32 package, available
   from www.cygwin.com.  get that package and install it, then unpack libwv
   and run ./configure. Then just add -DWINDOWS to the compiler flags are you
   are off. i.e. change

      CC = gcc

   to

      CC = gcc -DWINDOWS

   The only thing that extra define does is change the / to \, in the scanning
   of a command line so as to find the name of the word doc without the
   prepended path.

   I haven't tried libwv under windows since zlib or the libwmf library were
   needed to be installed for full functionality, but i imagine that compiling
   them under cygwin32 would go smoothly as well, let me know on that one.

   It should also be possible to build using Mingw32/MSYS on Windows as well.
   The build instructions are similar to the above.

   For binary packages, please visit http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wv.htm

7. libwv for Mac OS X
   --------------------------------

   Instructions here are for building wv-0.7.5 and installing in the directory
   /opt/wv-0.7.5, using Jaguar's default shell; modify as appropriate...

   Note: To create /opt you will need root access - i.e., login to an
         administrator account and use sudo mkdir /opt. In fact I (fjf) prefer
         to give this a non-system ownership, e.g.:

	# sudo /bin/bash
	password: 
	$ mkdir /opt
	$ chgrp Staff /opt
	$ chmod 2775 /opt

         but it's your call. Some people prefer /usr/local. I like /opt.
         HOWEVER: /opt will not show up in the finder - which can be a pain...

   Note: Of course, if it's just you who wishes to use it, then you can always
         install under your home directory, e.g.: /Users/fjf/fjf

   Instructions by Manos Krokos
   ----------------------------

   Install Fink so you get the latest versions of libiconv and libpng 
   and then do the following:

   1. Untar the wv source into your home directory.
   2. cd into the wv-0.7.5 directory
   3. type:

	env CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include" LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib" ./configure --prefix=/opt/wv-0.7.5

      [those of you who, like me (fjf), prefer bash, just omit the 'env']

   4. type 'make'
   5. type 'make install'
   6. type 'pico ~/.cshrc'
   7. In the text editor that will open in your terminal window, add the 
      following line:

	set path = ( /opt/wv-0.7.5/bin $path )

   8. Use the wv commands like this (example):

	wvHtml --targetdir=<DIR> file.doc file.html

      Substitute 'Html' with the command of your choice or taste

8. Running wvHtml from Netscape
   ----------------------------

   There are some scripts in helper-scripts that were sent to me to get
   netscape to use libwv as a helper application. I don't know anything about
   them, and they might not work, especially as the program changes while they
   don't, but they are a useful resource, i believe the nsopen nswordview are
   your best bet for this.

9. libwv crashes
   -------------

   I don't believe you. You question the worthiness of my Code? I should kill
   you where you stand!, but seriously, follow these steps to help me.

      make clean
      CFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG=1" ./configure [etc.]
      make
      make install

   Run and send the output to a temporary file, and generate a core dump.
   For tcsh:

      limit core unlimited

   and run again. Then do:

      gdb libwv core

   and type:

      backtrace

   Send the output of gdb to me with the bugreport and the output from the
   -DDEBUG libwv and if possible send me the file that libwv crashed on as
   well. If the word file is particulary big, compress it for me please.
   Please mention your platform and libwv version.

================ standard configure help file follows... ================

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
