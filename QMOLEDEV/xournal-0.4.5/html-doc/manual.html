<p>
 Xournal is an application for notetaking, sketching, keeping
 a journal using a stylus. It is free software (GNU GPL) and runs
 on Linux (recent distributions) and other GTK+/Gnome platforms.
 It is similar to Microsoft Windows Journal or
 to other alternatives such as 
 <a href="http://www.dklevine.com/general/software/tc1000/jarnal.htm">Jarnal</a>
 and <a href="http://www.adebenham.com/gournal/">Gournal</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xournal can be downloaded at
<a href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">http://xournal.sourceforge.net/</a> or 
<a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/software/xournal/">http://math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/software/xournal/</a>
</p>
<p>
 Xournal aims to provide superior graphical quality (subpixel resolution) and overall
 functionality; however various advanced features have not been implemented
 yet.

<h2 class="subtitle">Getting started</h2>
<p>
 Xournal's user interface is (hopefully) intuitive, and if you don't run
 into <a href="manual.html#installation">installation</a> or
 <a href="manual.html#calibration">tablet calibration</a> issues, you'll
 probably be able to start taking notes without referring to this manual.
 <br />
 Here is a screenshot of the user interface (click to enlarge):

<a name="tools"></a>
<h2 class="subtitle">The drawing and selection tools</h2>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/pencil.png"> The pen</h3>
<p>
The pen is the default drawing tool in Xournal. It comes in a variety
of colors (see the color toolbar buttons and the Color submenu of the
Tools menu) and thicknesses (see the 
<a href="manual.html#thicknesses">thickness</a> toolbar buttons and
the Pen Options submenu of the Tools menu).
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/eraser.png"> The eraser</h3>
<p>
The eraser lets you erase what you have drawn. 
By default, stylus buttons 2 and 3 (mouse middle or right buttons) are
mapped to the eraser tool.
<br />
The eraser comes in three different thicknesses (selected using the
<a href="manual.html#thicknesses">thickness</a> toolbar buttons),
and can operate in three different modes (Eraser Options submenu of
the Tools menu):
<ul>
 <li>
   Standard mode (default): the eraser deletes portions
   of strokes previously drawn using the pen or the highlighter. 
   In this mode, if you erase in the middle of a stroke, the remaining 
   portions of the stroke are automatically split into shorter strokes.
   The background of the page (and the lower layers) are not erased.
 </li>
 <li>
   Whiteout: the eraser is actually a thick white pen, and simply covers
   whatever lies underneath, including the background of the page.
 </li>
 <li>
   Delete strokes: whenever the eraser comes in contact with a previously
   drawn stroke, the entire stroke is deleted.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/highlighter.png"> The highlighter</h3>
<p>
  Like the pen, the highlighter comes in a variety of colors (the default
  is yellow) and thicknesses. Use the color and thickness toolbar buttons
  to change these settings.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/text-tool.png"> The text tool</h3>
<p>
  To insert a new text item, click at the location where the text is to be
  inserted on the page, then type it in or paste it using the contextual
  menu (note: no wrapping is performed). To modify a text item, click inside
  it. The font and point size can be modified using the "Text Font" command
  in the Tools menu (or the toolbar button). The color is the same as that
  currently selected for the pen (and can be modified using the toolbar
  buttons).
</p>
<p>
  Text items can contain arbitrary Unicode characters, provided that a
  suitable font is installed on your system. However, languages written
  in a direction other than left-to-right might not be handled properly.
  If a journal contains some items in a font that is unavailable on your
  system, another one will be substituted. (Also, text items will be
  lost if the document is opened in a version of Xournal prior to 0.4).
  Finally, note that the printing and PDF export features only accept
  TrueType and Type 1 scalable fonts (do not use any bitmap fonts), and
  that the typesetting of the text may be slightly different in the
  printout.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/ruler.png"> The ruler</h3>
<p>
  The ruler is not a tool by itself, but rather a special operating mode
  of the pen and highlighter tools. When it is enabled, these tools paint
  line segments instead of curvy strokes. For simplicity, selecting the
  ruler when not in pen or highlighter mode automatically selects the pen.
</p>
<a name="recognizer"></a>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/shapes.png"> The shape recognizer</h3>
<p>
  The shape recognizer is also a special 
  operating mode of the pen and highlighter tools. When it is enabled,
  Xournal attempts to recognize geometric shapes as they are drawn, and
  if successful will replace the drawn strokes accordingly. The shapes
  that can be recognized are: line segments, circles, rectangles, arrows,
  triangles and quadrilaterals. Polygonal shapes can be drawn in a single
  stroke or in a sequence of consecutive strokes.
</p>
<p>
  The recognizer is set to be as unobtrusive as possible, and should not
  interfere too much with handwriting. (It differs in this and other ways
  from another shape recognizer written for Xournal by Lukasz Kaiser).
  As a result, it may only recognize shapes if you draw them carefully and
  deliberately. Specific tips for better recognition: (1) for circles,
  a closed curve that isn't quite round works better
  than a rounder curve that doesn't close; (2) for arrows, it is better
  to lift the pen before drawing the tip of the arrow, and make sure
  the tip consists of two straight line segments;
  (3) for very elongated rectangles,
  recognition tends to be better if you lift the pen between consecutive
  sides.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/recycled.png"> Default tools</h3>
<p>
  Each tool (pen, eraser, highlighter, text) has a default setting
  (color, thickness, ... for the drawing tools, font and size for the
  text tool) associated to it.
  The "Default Pen", "Default Eraser", "Default Highlighter", and
  "Default Text" entries of
  the Tools menu select the appropriate tool and reset its settings to
  the defaults. The toolbar also includes a "Default" button which
  resets the currently selected tool to its default settings,
  and a "Default Pen" button. <br />
  The "Set As Default" entry of the Tools menu takes the current settings
  of the currently selected tool and makes them the new default.
</p>
<a name="thicknesses"></a>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/thin.png"> <img src="pixmaps/medium.png">
  <img src="pixmaps/thick.png"> Thickness buttons</h3>
<p>
  These three buttons control the thickness of the current drawing tool
  (pen, eraser, or highlighter). The thickness can also be adjusted using
  the appropriate sub-menu of the Tools menu.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/rect-select.png"> Rectangle selection</h3>
<p>
  This tool lets you select a rectangular region of the current layer.
  All the strokes which are entirely contained within the rectangular region
  are selected.
  The selection can be moved within its page by clicking inside the
  selection rectangle and dragging the cursor. If the cursor is dragged
  to a different page, the selection will be moved to the topmost layer of
  that page.
</p>
<p>
  The selection can be cut, duplicated, etc. (including to a different page
  or to a different journal) using the copy-paste toolbar buttons or the
  corresponding entries of the Edit menu.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/stretch.png"> Vertical space</h3>
<p>
  This tool lets you insert or remove vertical space within the page:
  all the items of the current layer which lie entirely between the cursor
  position and the end of the page are moved up or down.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the background, and items on other layers, are not affected.
  Also, if you insert too much vertical space, some items may fall below
  the bottom of the page and become invisible. These items are not lost:
  to retrieve them, either use
  the vertical space tool again to remove the excess vertical
  space, or change the page height to an appropriate value (using the
  "Paper Size" entry in the Journal menu).
</p>
<p>
  If you drag the cursor below the bottom of the page (so that the
  entire block being moved has become invisible), the items will be moved
  to the next page (topmost layer); however, any items that were already
  present on the next page are left unchanged. Similarly, dragging the
  cursor above the top of the page so that the entire block being moved
  becomes invisible results in the items being moved to the previous page.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub"><img src="pixmaps/hand.png"> Hand tool</h3>
<p>
  This tool lets you browse the journal; dragging the cursor scrolls the
  view.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Undo and redo</h3>
<p>
  All operations performed on the currently open journal (drawing, erasing,
  cut-and-paste; adding, deleting, and reformatting pages; etc.) can be
  undone and redone at will using the Undo and Redo toolbar buttons or
  the corresponding entries in the Edit menu.<br />
  There is no limit to the depth of the undo/redo stack. It is cleared only
  when you quit the application or open a new journal.
</p>
<a name="mappings"></a>
<h3 class="subsub">Button mappings</h3>
<p>
  Stylus buttons 2 and 3 (mouse middle and right buttons) can be mapped
  to different tools using the appropriate submenus in the Options menu
  (whereas the Tools menu and the toolbar buttons affect the primary tool
  assigned to button 1). The default mapping is the eraser.
</p>
<p><b>Advanced configuration:</b>
  if a secondary button is mapped to a drawing tool (pen, eraser, or
  highlighter), the default is to "dynamically link" its settings to those
  of the primary tool, which means that each drawing tool has common
  settings (color, thickness, etc.) for all buttons.
  Dynamic linking of brush settings
  can be disabled by selecting the "Copy of current brush" option in the
  "Button mapping" submenu. The settings of the tool for button 2 or 3 are
  copied from the button 1 settings at the time when you select the option,
  and afterwards they are no longer updated when the button 1 settings are
  modified, thus making it possible to assign pens of different colors or
  thicknesses to different buttons.
</p>
<p>
  Another option that affects button mappings is the "Eraser tip" option.
  If this option is turned on and the XInput extensions are enabled, then
  the eraser tip of your tablet's stylus will automatically be remapped to
  the eraser tool. This behavior, which overrides all other button mappings,
  is most useful if your X server is configured to map the eraser tip of
  your tablet's stylus to button 1.
</p>
<p>
  Also note the "Buttons switch mappings" option, which may be useful to
  users of external tablets: when this option is turned on, buttons 2 and 3
  only switch the tool mapping, and drawing is still done with button 1.
</p>
<hr />
<a name="pages-layers"></a>
<h2 class="subtitle">Pages, layers, and backgrounds</h2>
<p>
A journal is composed of one or more pages, whose characteristics can be
modified independently of each other. Each page consists of a background
and one or more layers stacked on top of the background. All drawing
operations take place within a single layer, and do not affect the background
or the other layers. You can think of the layers as transparent overlays:
drawing and erasing always takes place on the topmost visible overlay.
<br />
Layers are a convenient mechanism to add temporary annotations on top of a
journal page: because of the logical separation between layers, erasing
in the top layer will not affect the contents of the other layers, and
the top layer can be easily discarded.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Navigating the journal</h3>
<p>
The user interface either displays all pages in the journal below each other
("continuous mode") or a single page ("one-page mode"). You can switch
between the two modes by using the "Continuous" and "One page" entries in
the View menu. The default is the
continuous mode, best adapted to note-taking on multiple pages. The one-page
mode is more appropriate if your journal is a scrapbook in which the pages
have different characteristics (in particular, if you are annotating a
series of pictures of different sizes).
</p>
<p>
You can navigate the journal pages in several different ways:
<ul>
 <li> using the navigation toolbar buttons (or the corresponding entries
  in the View menu) to go back or forward one page, or to jump to the first
  or last page of the journal;
 </li>
 <li> in continuous mode, scrolling down to the desired page;
 </li>
 <li> entering a value or using the +/- buttons in the page selection box
  at the lower-left corner of the Xournal window.
 </li>
</ul>
As a convenient shortcut, going forward one page (or pressing the + button
in the selection box) when already at the end of the journal creates a new
page at the end of the journal.
</p>
<p>
Note: jumping to a page automatically selects the top-most layer in
that page.
</p>
<p>
To navigate the layers of a page, either use the layer selection box at
the bottom of the Xournal window, or use the "Show Layer" and "Hide Layer"
entries in the View menu. The basic rule to remember is that the display
shows all the layers underneath the currently select one, and while those
above it are hidden.
</p>
<p>
Note: the background layer cannot be drawn on; any attempt to draw on the
background will generate an error message and switch back to the first
layer.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Managing pages and layers</h3>
<p>
Pages can be added to the journal by using the "New Page ..." entries in
the Journal menu. The newly created page has the same format and background as the
current page (for the "New Page Before" and "New Page After" commands), or
as the last page of the journal (for "New Page At End"). Additionally,
jumping to the next page when already on the last page creates a new page
at the end of the journal.
</p>
<p>
The "Delete Page" entry in the Journal menu removes the current page from
the journal. (Remember that you can always undo this operation if you
deleted a page by accident).
</p>
<p>
The "New Layer" entry in the Journal menu creates a new layer immediately
above the current one, while "Delete Layer" removes the current layer and
its contents (if you attempt to delete the only layer of a page, a new
empty layer will be automatically created).
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Paper formats and backgrounds</h3>
<p>
The size of the current page can be modified using the "Paper Size" entry
in the Journal menu. Standard and custom sizes are available.
</p>
<p>
The background is either one of several kinds of standard paper types, or a
bitmap image, or a page of a PDF file.
</p>
<p>
To select a <b>standard paper type</b> as background for the current page, use
the "Paper Style" submenu of the Journal menu. The paper color can also
be changed using the "Paper Color" submenu of the Journal menu.
</p>
<p>
To use a <b>PDF file</b> as the background for a journal, see the paragraph
on <a href="manual.html#pdfannotate">PDF annotation</a> below.
</p>
<p>
To load a <b>bitmap image file</b> for use as background for the current page, use
the "Load Background" entry of the Journal menu. This automatically
resizes the current page according to the size of the bitmap image, and
resets the zoom level to 100%. If <i>ghostscript</i> is installed on your
system, you can also use this method to import a fixed-resolution bitmap
version of a Postscript or PDF file; in that case, all pages will be
imported sequentially as backgrounds into consecutive pages (this is
<i>not</i> the
recommended method; PDF annotation is better in every respect).
</p>
<p>
To capture a <b>screenshot</b> of a window or the entire screen and make it
the background of the current page, use the "Background Screenshot" entry of
the Journal menu. This will iconify the Xournal window; click in any window
(after ensuring it is fully visible) to capture its contents, or click on
the desktop (or screen background) to capture the entire screen.
</p>
<p><b>Important note:</b> by default, bitmap images loaded using the "Load
Background" command will not be saved with the journal; instead, the journal
file will contain a reference to the absolute location of the image file.
This means that the background will become unavailable if the image file
is moved or deleted. To avoid this, check the option "Attach file to the
journal" at the bottom of the file selection dialog box.<br />
This option only applies to bitmap image files loaded from disk;
screenshot backgrounds (and bitmaps converted from PS/PDF files using
ghostscript) are automatically "attached" to the journal file: when the
journal is saved, they will be saved (in PNG format) along with it
(using file names of the form *.xoj.bg_*.png).
</p>

<a name="pdfannotate"></a>
<h3 class="subsub">PDF annotation</h3>
<p>
Xournal can be used to annotate PDF files, by loading the pages of a PDF
file as backgrounds for a journal. As of version 0.4.5 this is done using
the <i>poppler</i> library (previous versions used the
<i>pdftoppm</i> converter, which is part of the <i>xpdf</i> utilities or
the <i>poppler</i> utilities depending on distributions).
</p>
<p>
The "Annotate PDF" command in the File menu can be used to load a PDF file
into a new (empty) journal. The page backgrounds and page sizes correspond
to the contents of the PDF file. (Most unencrypted PDF files should be
supported).
</p>
<p>
By default, the PDF file used to generate the backgrounds
will not be saved with the journal; instead, the journal
file will contain a reference to the absolute location of this file.
This means that all backgrounds will become unavailable if the PDF file
is moved or deleted (although Xournal will let you specify
the updated location of the PDF file when opening the journal
file). To avoid this, check the option "Attach file to the journal"
at the bottom of the dialog box when opening the PDF file. The PDF file will
then be saved along with the journal (using a file name of the form
*.xoj.bg.pdf).
<p>
Upon zooming, the page backgrounds are asynchronously updated
to fit the current display resolution. Since this process is quite slow and
memory-intensive, the pages are normally updated only as needed, when they
become visible on the screen (unless you disable the "Progressive
Backgrounds" option in the Options menu). This means that you will
occasionally notice the page backgrounds being updated while you are
scrolling inside the document (at large zoom levels, it can take a while
for the updated background to appear). 
<!-- However, since the backgrounds are generated asynchronously by a 
separate Unix process, you can keep drawing in the journal
while the update process is still in progress. -->
</p>
<p>
It is strongly recommended that you do not resize PDF pages (using the
"Paper Size" command). This will result in extremely ugly rendering, as
the PDF converter is unable to render bitmaps with
non-standard aspect ratios.
</p>
<p>
While you can perform all sorts of page operations on a journal file
that was created from a PDF file (such as duplicating or deleting pages,
inserting pages with blank or bitmapped backgrounds, ...), it is not
possible to include pages from more than one PDF file into a single journal
document. If you need to annotate two or more PDF files inside a same
journal document, please consider using an external utility for merging
PDF files (for example <i>pdfmerge</i>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> the PDF backgrounds are
rescaled and/or regenerated as needed when the zoom level is changed.
Because this consumes a lot of memory and CPU resources, by default this
rescaling is performed on-demand as each page becomes visible. This means
that you will occasionally notice backgrounds being generated while
you are scrolling inside the document (at large zoom levels, this can slow
down the screen refresh rate noticeably). If you'd prefer all backgrounds to
be loaded in advance and rescaled immediately upon changing the zoom level,
disable the "Progressive Backgrounds" option in the Options menu. Be aware
that this increases the memory consumption and will cause out-of-memory
crashes when viewing long documents.
</p>

<hr />
<a name="printing"></a>
<h2 class="subtitle">Printing</h2>
<p>
As of version 0.4.5, Xournal uses the gtk-print architecture for printing
(previous versions used gnome-print). Xournal also includes a native PDF 
printing feature.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Printing via gtk-print</h3>
<p>
The print dialog box lets you select a printer
(either one of the printers installed on your system, or the "Print to File"
virtual printer), and a range of pages to print (the default is to print 
the entire journal). Each page
of the journal is automatically rescaled so as to fit the paper size.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the older gnome-print architecture, gtk-print and poppler make it
possible to efficiently print files that annotate PDF backgrounds. (Prior to
version 0.4.5, PDF backgrounds had to be converted to bitmaps upon printing,
resulting in huge print jobs and low printout quality).
</p>
<p>
The settings are currently not saved properly from one print job to
the next, so make sure to verify the settings.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Exporting to PDF</h3>
<p>
Xournal also provides its own PDF rendering
engine. The "Export to PDF" command (in the File menu) produces a
PDF-1.4 file from the currently loaded document. The pages of the
resulting PDF file have the same size as in Xournal. Highlighter strokes
are rendered in a partially transparent manner (note however that
applications such as xpdf and ghostview do not always handle
PDF transparency properly). Text items are rendered by embedding
TrueType subsets or Type 1 fonts into the PDF document as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Xournal includes a PDF file parser compatible with PDF format
version 1.4; the compression features of PDF 1.5 are
not supported. When exporting a document that uses PDF
backgrounds, Xournal attempts to preserve most of the structure of
the original PDF file (however, auxiliary data such as thumbnails, hyperlinks,
and annotations are lost). If Xournal is unable to parse the PDF
file, the backgrounds are converted to (compressed) bitmaps and a new
PDF file is generated from scratch.
</p>
<hr />
<a name="configuration"></a>
<h2 class="subtitle">Configuration file</h2>
<p>
Xournal's configuration settings are saved to the file
<tt>~user/.xournal/config</tt> by using the "Save
Preferences" command in the Options menu. The settings saved in the
configuration file include in particular:
<ul>
<li>general display preferences: zoom level, window size, ...</li>
<li>default paper settings (as set by the "Set As Default" command in
the Journal menu)</li>
<li>default settings for the pen, eraser, highlighter, and text tools
(as set by the "Set As Default" command in the Tools menu)</li>
<li>mappings for buttons 2 and 3</li>
<li>the various preferences set in the Options menu</li>
</ul>
The configuration file also gives access to additional customization
options which cannot be set from the user interface, such as: the
display resolution in pixels per inch, the step increment in zoom factors,
the tool selected at startup, the thickness of the various drawing tools,
the default directory for opening and saving files, the visibility and
position of the menu and toolbars, ...
</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of configuration file settings:
<ul> 
<li> <p><b>Display settings</b> (in the <tt><b>[general]</b></tt> section): <ul>
<li><tt><b>display_dpi:</b></tt>

<li><tt><b>view_continuous:</b></tt> 
whether to start in continuous or single-page view mode (see also View menu)</li>
<li><tt><b>highlighter_opacity:</b></tt> 
the opacity level of highlighter strokes (from 0 to 1; 1 is fully opaque).
Note that .xoj files do not store the opacity level of strokes, so if you
change from the default value of 0.5 your files will look different when
opened on another machine.</li>

</p>
<hr />
<a name="file-format"></a>
<h2 class="subtitle">The file format</h2>
<h3 class="subsub">Overall structure</h3>
<p>
Xournal stores its data in gzipped XML-like files. The gzipped data consists
of a succession of XML tags describing the document. By convention, the
file header and trailer look like this:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;xournal version="..."&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Xournal document - see http://math.mit.edu/~auroux/software/xournal/&lt;/title&gt;
... sequence of pages ...
&lt;/xournal&gt;
</pre>
The &lt;title&gt; and &lt;xournal&gt; tags may only appear within the file
header (not within the pages of the document). The <i>version</i> attribute of
the &lt;xournal&gt; tag indicates which version of Xournal was used to
create the document; it is currently ignored, but may be used in a later
release if the file format changes in an incompatible manner.
(Following a suggestion of Matteo Abrate, starting with version 0.4 the
&lt;xournal&gt; tag is the document's root tag, and encloses all other tags).
</p>
<p>
The rest of the file is a sequence of pages, specified by a
&lt;page&gt; tag, whose attributes <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> specify the
physical size of the page in points (1/72 in). The width and height
parameters are floating point values. The format of a page is therefore:
<pre>
&lt;page width="..." height="..."&gt;
... page contents ...
&lt;/page&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Page background</h3>
<p>
The first entry within a page describes the page background.
It consists of a &lt;background&gt; tag followed by several mandatory
XML attributes. The first attribute is always <i>type</i>, which
can take three possible values: "solid" for a solid background, "pixmap"
for a bitmap background, and "pdf" if the background is a page of a PDF
document. The rest of the attributes depends on the type of background.
<ul>
<li><p> Solid background: <tt>&lt;background type="solid" color="..."
style="..." /&gt;</tt> <br />The <i>color</i> attribute takes one of
the standard values "white", "yellow", "pink", "orange", "blue", "green",
or can specify a hexadecimal RGBA value in the format "#rrggbbaa". The
<i>style</i> attribute takes one of the standard values "plain", "lined",
"ruled", or "graph".</p>
</li>
<li><p> Bitmap background: <tt>&lt;background type="pixmap" domain="..."
filename="..." /&gt;</tt> <br />
The <i>domain</i> attribute takes one of the standard values "absolute",
"attach", or "clone". A value of "absolute" indicates that the bitmap is
found in the file specified by <i>filename</i>. The bitmap can be in any
format recognized by the gdk-pixbuf library; this includes most of the
common bitmap formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, PCX, PNM, TIFF, ...).
<br />A value
of "attach" indicates that the bitmap is an attachment to the Xournal file.
The bitmap is in PNG format, and resides in a file whose name is derived
from that of the main Xournal file by appending to it a dot and the contents
of the <i>filename</i> attribute. For example, if the Xournal file is in
<tt>file.xoj</tt> and the <i>filename</i> attribute is <tt>"bg_1.png"</tt>
then the bitmap file is <tt>file.xoj.bg_1.png</tt> (Xournal saves attached
bitmaps sequentially in files ...bg_1.png, ...bg_2.png, etc.)
<br />A value of "clone" indicates that the bitmap is identical to the
background of a previous page of the journal; the <i>filename</i> attribute
then specifies the page number, starting with 0 for the first page. For
example, if a <i>filename</i> value of <tt>"1"</tt> indicates that the
background bitmap is identical to that of the second page.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> PDF background: <tt>&lt;background type="pdf" domain="..."
filename="..." pageno="..." /&gt;</tt> or
<tt>&lt;background type="pdf" pageno="..." /&gt;</tt>
<br />The <i>domain</i> and <i>filename</i> attributes must be specified
for the first page of the journal that uses a PDF background, and must
be omitted subsequently for every other page that uses a PDF background.
The <i>domain</i> attribute takes one of the standard values
"absolute" and "attach"; the PDF document is to be found in the file
specified by <i>filename</i> (if <i>domain</i> is "absolute"), or in the
file whose name is obtained by appending a dot and the contents of the
<i>filename</i> attribute to the name of the main Xournal file (if
<i>domain</i> is "attach"). The <i>pageno</i> attribute specifies which
page of the PDF file is used as background, starting with 1 for the first
page of the PDF file.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Layers and strokes</h3>
<p>
After the line specifying the background, the remainder of a &lt;page&gt;
section is occupied by one or more layer sections
<pre>&lt;layer&gt; ... &lt;/layer&gt;</pre>
describing the various items within a layer. Every page must
contain at least one layer; a layer may be empty. The successive layers
are listed in their stacking order, from bottom to top.
</p>
<p>
A layer consists of a collection of items, listed in the order in which
they should be drawn
(from bottom-most to top-most).
Up to version 0.3.3, the only legal contents within a layer are 
strokes. The format of a stroke is:
<pre>&lt;stroke tool="..." color="..." width="..."&gt;
... list of coordinates ...
&lt;/stroke&gt;
</pre>
The <i>tool</i> attribute can take the values "pen", "highlighter", or
"eraser" depending on the tool used to create the stroke (pen, highlighter,
or whiteout eraser); a value of "highlighter" indicates that the stroke
should be painted in a partially transparent manner (Xournal uses an alpha
coefficient of 0.5).
</p>
<p>
The <i>color</i> attribute can take one of the standard values "black",
"blue", "red", "green", "gray", "lightblue", "lightgreen", "magenta",
"orange", "yellow", "white", or can specify a hexadecimal RGBA value in
the format "#rrggbbaa". 
</p>
<p>
The <i>width</i> attribute is a floating-point
number (or a sequence of floating-point numbers starting with version 0.4.2),
and specifies the width of the stroke in points (1/72 in). (For a
variable-width stroke, the <i>width</i> attribute contains a
whitespace-separated succession of floating-point values: first the
nominal brush width, and then the width of each successive segment forming
the stroke.)
</p>
<p>
The list of coordinates is simply a succession of floating-point values,
separated by whitespace.
The number of given values must be even; consecutive pairs of values give
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of each point along the stroke.
These values are expressed in points (1/72 in). The coordinates (0,0)
represent the top-left corner of the page: hence x is measured from the left
of the page, and y is measured from the top of the page.
</p>
<p>
Every stroke must contain at least two points (four floating point values).
Moreover, two consecutive points on the stroke should be spaced no more
than 5 units apart or so; longer line segments should be subdivided as
appropriate (otherwise the eraser tool will not interact properly with the
stroke). The default precision used by Xournal for the x,y coordinates is
0.01 unit (1/7200 in).
</p>
<p>Starting with version 0.4, layers also contain text items.
The format of a text item is:
<pre>&lt;text font="..." size="..." x="..." y="..." color="..."&gt;... text ...&lt;/text&gt;
</pre>
The <i>font</i> attribute contains the font name, for example "Serif Bold
Italic"; if the font is not available, another font will be substituted.
The <i>size</i> attribute specifies the font size in points. The <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> attributes specify the coordinates of the top-left corner
of the text box in page coordinates (measured in points from the top-left
corner of the page). Finally, the <i>color</i> attribute contains either
the name of a standard color or a hexadecimal RGBA value (see above).
</p>
<p>
The contents of the text are encoded in UTF-8, with the characters
<tt>'&amp;', '&lt;', '&gt;'</tt> replaced by <tt>&amp;amp;, &amp;lt;,
&amp;gt;</tt>. Whitespace and linefeeds are preserved (in particular,
no extraneous whitespace should be inserted between the enclosing tags
and the text itself).
</p>

<a name="installation"></a>
<h2 class="subtitle">Installation issues</h2>
<h3 class="subsub">Dependencies</h3>
<p>
The following libraries are required to run Xournal (they are standard on
modern Linux distributions such as Fedora 6 or later, RHEL 5 or
later, Ubuntu 6.10 or later, etc.):
<ul>
 <li> the <b>gtk+</b> libraries, version <b>2.10</b> or later 
 (package gtk2 and dependencies)</li>
 <li> <b>libgnomecanvas</b> version <b>2.4</b> or later &nbsp;
 (package libgnomecanvas and dependencies)</li>
 <li> <b>poppler-glib</b> version <b>0.5.4</b> or later &nbsp;

</ul>
</p>
<p>
 Optional:
<ul>
 <li> ghostscript (optional: used to import PS/PDF files as bitmap 
 backgrounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>
To compile Xournal, you also need the <b>development packages</b> for the above
libraries (packages gtk2-devel, libgnomecanvas-devel, poppler-glib-devel,
and dependencies), as well as <b>autoconf</b> and
<b>automake</b>.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Compilation and installation procedure</h3>
<p>
Download the Xournal distribution tar.gz file, and any needed dependencies.
</p>
<p>
<b>Compilation and installation in /usr/local:</b>
<pre>
./configure

(as root) make desktop-install
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>Compilation and installation in $HOME:</b>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=$HOME

<h2 class="subtitle">Tablet calibration issues</h2>
<p>
Configuring the tablet devices properly is unfortunately not as simple as it
ought to be. This is a subject worthy of a detailed how-to document;
meanwhile, here are some hints about how to configure your tablet.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">Basics</h3>
<p>
Xournal uses the XInput extension to obtain high-resolution coordinates for
strokes drawn using the stylus. If you decide that getting just the right
XInput configuration isn't worth the effort, you can disable XInput features
by unsetting the "Use XInput" option in the Options menu. The price to pay
is a lower graphics quality, as the resolution of all strokes then drops to
1 pixel (instead of the native resolution of the tablet device, which can
be higher by several orders of magnitude).
</p>
<p>
The configuration of tablet devices is controlled in the X server's
configuration file (usually <b>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</b> depending on your
distribution). The latest X servers can detect a tablet automatically and
do not require the presence of xorg.conf to work properly; so recent
distributions typically no longer includde such a file. However, if
auto-configuration fails, you can always create a xorg.conf that explicitly
specifies tablet devices.
</p>
<p>
Assuming you do have a xorg.conf, the ServerLayout section should contain lines like:
<pre>
Section "ServerLayout"
        ...
        InputDevice    "cursor" "SendCoreEvents"
        InputDevice    "stylus" "SendCoreEvents"
        InputDevice    "eraser" "SendCoreEvents"
EndSection
</pre>
(the last one only if your stylus has an eraser tip), and your configuration
file should include sections such as
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier "cursor"
        Driver "wacom"
        Option "Device" "/dev/ttyS0"
        Option "Type" "cursor"
        Option "ForceDevice" "ISDV4"
        Option "BottomX" "28800"
        Option "BottomY" "21760"
        Option "Mode" "absolute"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier "stylus"
        Driver "wacom"
        Option "Device" "/dev/ttyS0"
        Option "Type" "stylus"
        Option "ForceDevice" "ISDV4"
        Option "BottomX" "28800"
        Option "BottomY" "21760"

The actual settings will depend on your hardware; look on the web for Linux
installation instructions specific to your model: for example, the
"Device" settings above correspond to a serial port protocol, many tablets
use USB instead; the BottomX and BottomY values correspond to the physical
resolution of the tablet and will vary from one model to another.
</p>
<p>
For historical reasons, most X servers do not allow the input device
designated as the "core pointer" in the X server's configuration file
to be used as an XInput extension device. Thus, your tablet input devices
should <b>not</b> be designated as the core pointer device. Instead, they
should be configured with the "SendCoreEvents" option, which enables them
to simultaneously generate XInput extension events and move the cursor on
the screen. 
</p>
<p>
<b>If you have a newer X server</b> and no xorg.conf file, the input devices can be
configured using the <i>xinput</i> command.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> with older X servers, only tablet devices are XInput devices, while
a built-in pointing device or an external mouse would only act as the core
pointer. In newer X servers, all devices are handled through XInput (even
though without advanced capabilities), though mice and touchpads typically
send invalid event data. Xournal tries to work around the most common bugs
in input device drivers and GTK+ input event processing.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">The cursor doesn't appear in the right place...</h3>
<p>
If the mouse pointer does not follow accurately the position of the stylus,
this is an indication that your tablet is not properly calibrated. If you
have the linuxwacom package, you can try modifying the tablet calibration
using <b>xsetwacom</b>. The relevant parameters are named TopX, BottomX,
TopY, BottomY, and need to be set separately for the stylus and for the
eraser. For example:
<pre>
    xsetwacom set stylus TopX 270
    xsetwacom set stylus BottomX 28510
    ...
</pre>
(the TopX and TopY parameters default to 0 if you haven't set them in your
X server's configuration file). Experiment with these parameters until you
find the right calibration settings for your tablet (i.e., the mouse pointer
appears right under the tip of the stylus).
</p>
<p>
Once you have found the perfect settings for your tablet, update your X
server's configuration file or startup scripts.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> on older systems, the TopX and TopY values should always
be kept at 0 to avoid calibration bugs.
</p>
<h3 class="subsub">The cursor is in the right place, but strokes aren't 
drawn under the cursor...</h3>
<p>
If you experience this while trying to draw with a mouse, touchpad, or other
non-tablet device:
<ul>
<li> If you don't have a tablet, simply disable "Use XInput" in the Options
menu, this is the fastest way of fixing the problem.</li>
<li> Upgrade to a recent version of Xournal (0.4.5 or later). Older versions
of Xournal are not compatible with the event handling code of recent X server
and GTK+ library versions.</li>
<li> Check that the "Discard Core Events" option is disabled
(<tt>discard_corepointer</tt> should be set to <tt>false</tt> in
~/.xournal/config).</li>
</ul>
If you experience this while trying to draw with a tablet pen:
<ul>
<li> If you are using an obsolete version of the linuxwacom driver (before
0.7.6) or of GTK+, please upgrade your system.</li>
<li>If you are using GTK+ 2.17 or newer, please upgrade to Xournal 0.4.5 or
later. The input event processing behavior of GTK+ has changed and is no
longer compatible with older versions of Xournal.</li>
<li> The display geometry might have changed since the beginning of your
session in Xournal
(resolution changed, external monitor connected, display rotated, etc.).
You need to exit Xournal and re-start it each time your display
configuration changes.</li>
<li> Your tablet devices might be incorrectly calibrated or configured.</li>
</ul>
If all else fails, you can disable XInput support in Xournal (in the
Options menu), at a price of a severe loss of resolution (and the eraser tip
won't be detected anymore).
</p>
<p>
I have also had a report that one of the workarounds used by Xournal to
bypass a calibration bug in GTK+ can actually entirely prevent strokes
from being drawn. If you are being unsuccessful at drawing in Xournal
with XInput enabled, try recompiling after commenting out the line
<pre>#define ENABLE_XINPUT_BUGFIX</pre>
near the beginning of <tt>src/xournal.h</tt>.
If this modification does improve things for you, and if you have a bit
of spare time to help investigate the causes of this problem, please
contact me.

<h3 class="subsub">On-the-fly display rotation</h3>
<p> 
You need an X server that supports the RANDR extension, and a sufficiently
recent (0.7.6 or later) 
version of the linuxwacom driver to support on-the-fly rotation.
</p>
<p>
To set the tablet in portrait mode:
<pre>
  xrandr -o 3
  xsetwacom set stylus Rotate cw
</pre>
To return to landscape mode:
<pre>
  xrandr -o 0
  xsetwacom set stylus Rotate none
</pre>
<b>Note #1:</b> you should not rotate the display while Xournal is running,
otherwise the tablet calibration in Xournal may (and most likely will)
become incorrect.
Exit Xournal and restart it after the display has been rotated.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note #2:</b> the syntax of xrandr commands has changed in newer X servers.
Consult the xrandr manual page for the new syntax.
