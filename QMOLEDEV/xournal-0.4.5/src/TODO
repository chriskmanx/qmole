List of features to be implemented (not in any particular order)
----------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS DONE IN THIS RELEASE:

DONE: fix GTK+ 2.16/2.17 XInput issues with scrollbars and menus
DONE: fix bug 2826845 (shape recognizer accel doesn't work in fullscreen mode)
DONE: bug affecting resize zone in statusbar
DONE: page spinbutton wide enough for 3 digits; avoid "deprecated" warning
DONE: edit->paste command should refresh toolbar to unselect color/thickness
      (so can repaint sel)
DONE: cursor doesn't reset properly after selection operation if primary
      tool is select mode (stays with arrow cursor instead of pointer)
DONE: device with "eraser" at the end of its name is of type ERASER
      (Edward Yang)
DONE: fix_xinput_coords() replaces buggy xinput events by core pointer 
      coordinates
DONE: use poppler to render PDF backgrounds (after patches contributed
      by Mike Ter Louw and Bob McElrath)
DONE: gettext internationalization (contributed by David Planella)
DONE: Catalan translation (by David Planella); French translation
DONE: fix unresponsiveness to button events in text edition box (GTK+ 2.17)
      and segfaults when dragging text or using Layers combobox (GTK+ 2.17)
DONE: Esc leaves text box if editing; and leaves fullscreen mode
DONE: package our own copy of the ttsubset library (to remove a dependency
      on libgnomeprint), and create TT subfonts in memory
DONE: use gtk-print instead of libgnomeprint
DONE: remove deprecated "antialias bg" option
DONE: fix fix_xinput_coords so it works ok without ENABLE_XINPUT_BUGFIX ?
DONE: disable ctrl-left/right accelerators during text edition
DONE: custom color chooser button (after a patch contributed by Alex Ray)
DONE: remember last used directory (after a patch contributed by Lu Zhihe)
DONE: discard Alt-click and Control-click events
DONE: option to have buttons *toggle* the tool rather than act as tool
       (ie button 2 causes button 1 to map to tool 2) [Dylan Thurston]
DONE: patch to fix focus + allow up/dn in single page mode (Bob McElrath)
DONE: patch to fix underscores in MRU filename display (Bob McElrath)
DONE: patch to avoid tiny file dialogs (Bob McElrath)
DONE: further fixes for focus; can Esc out of page selection box
DONE: further fixes for xinput under GTK+ 2.17
DONE: option to auto-load *.pdf.xoj instead of *.pdf (Bob McElrath)
DONE: look for PDF backgrounds in path of xoj file before prompting user
DONE: paper color chooser (after a patch by ojb)
DONE: remove "Discard core events" from options menu
DONE: get_pressure_multiplier() accesses correct members of event union
DONE: address recognizer bug on single-segment strokes (division by 0)
DONE: remove binary installer (poppler is binary incompatible across versions)
      but provide configure script

REMAINING THINGS TO DO:

- collaborative editing (see discussion with Erik Demaine)
- porting to Win32 and MacOS; merge Nokia port
- multiple-scenario undo history

- collaborative: allow non-x86 endianness (for ints, for floats?)
- collaborative: have an initial undo item = contents of the initial
  xoj file + attachments for bitmap, pdf, and ps backgrounds

- cleanup of undo history (keep track of refcounts, delete old undo)
  save-and-clear-undo ?

- RandR / recalibration awareness?
  (e.g. if xinput events are far away from core events, re-query geometry?)
   or see if removing the GTK bugfix would help? -- e.g. by recalling an
   internal gtk init function?


** patch: ortho/snap (revised Apr 13 2009)
   xournal_ortho_snap_patch_4 (by Josef Pavlicek)

** patch (Ian-Woo Kim): multicolumn mode + LASSO SELECTION
   xournal_lasso_multipage_zoom_button_20090620.patch

** autosave patch (Edward Yang) (fix: optional only, w/ menu + cfgfile
   entries; fix: should clean up autosave.xoj.bg* files too; config interval)
   0001-Implement-autosave-for-documents-revised.patch (2 seconds after
   modification, vs original 5 seconds)

- PDF bg memory usage throttling / delete oldest pdf backgrounds
- replace ttsubset by something more modern? (eg. from cairo ?)
- auto-hide patch from ~/prog/src/xournal-autohide/ ?
     (check for cpu usage; handle BOTH edges
      and only (un)hide stuff at the correct edge!)
** UI update (Bob McElrath) -- eliminating status bar, compact layout,
   "compact interface" by default; themes, with line in config file
   to load pixmaps from pixmaps/$THEME/ (see Jan 9, 2009 emails)
- horizontal mode instead of dual-view / multicolumn ?
** "new page before/after" on a PDF bg page should ask: same page, other page of
  PDF file, default paper
- new recognizer icon (andruk on patches tracker)
- recognizer: if variable-width, associate average width
- recognizer should snap to existing recognized geometric shapes

- improve recognizer: two passes for polygons (low tolerance, then higher)
  to better detect elongated rectangles? (if low tolerance recognizer
  doesn't get a rectangle, then use higher tolerance for everything else,
  since otherwise there's too much risk of splitting a segment into 2)
- snap-to-grid (also for ruler & recognizer vertices)
  and maybe also snap-to-vertices (option for ruler and recognizer)?
- config option: config save current tool options instead of default ones

- bug in truetype subset generation w/ Adobe 9, see if gtk-print any better?

- drag-and-drop, copy-paste text & images directly into xournal
- proximity detection: eraser proximity switches mapping? 
  proximity out removes cursor until next motionnotify?

- render page to bitmap: for export, preview, and copy-paste
    (render using libart, see how gnomecanvas does it?)
    NO: render using Cairo !!! then can switch to GtkPrint as well.
    (copy-paste: config option to render only current layer or all below?)
- cut-and-paste of selection into other apps (as bitmap; as SVG?)
- navigation sidebar with bitmap page previews
- bitmap preview for document icon in desktop environments?
- "organizer" side panel (hierarchy of notes), cf. gjots
- see iRex code for generic viewer + PDF plugin including caching,
  throttling etc. (Marcel Hendrickx email of Sep 11 '09) 

- allow toolbar to go vertical
- toolbar buttons should react to button 2/3 click to modify settings
  for that tool?

- paste text directly into xournal, from xournal?
    (instead of starting a text item and pasting into/from it)
- insert links (to URLs; within document/to other xoj? hand mode navigates)
- increase width of spinPageNo to fit 3 digits
- should escape '_' to '__' in MRU menu entries (else become mnemonics)
- a command + keyboard shortcut to switch mappings (1<->2, 1<->3, 2<->3)
     (A. Rechnitzer Sept 11, 2007)
- modify encoding of TrueType font subsets or provide cmap so pdf text
  can be extracted

- smoothing of strokes (for users without tablets / with deficient drivers)
- lasso tool
- add config option to limit total memory usage for PDF bitmaps
- ability to select entire page for copy-paste (as bitmap / reorder xournal)
- copy/paste of an entire page (beware if PDF bg is not compatible!)
- rewrite printing using GtkPrint + Cairo as GnomePrint replacement
   (keep GnomePrint option for compatibility with GTK+ <2.10)
- insert images (screen capture or from file or from clipboard), 
  not as full-page backgrounds (new ITEM type)

- convert to/from Jarnal format; to/from MS Journal format???
- export as SVG, as bitmap (use Cairo for this)
- improved PDF viewer features (search text, hyperlink, page borders...)
   (using full poppler api ?)

- use system paper size as default (/etc/papersize)
- autoload *.pdf.xoj if present when opening *.pdf ???
- sticky notes (anchor visually text box to a bg location)
- use relative paths for bg documents (e.g. annotated PDF)
- flush display queue when drawing over a slow X server?
- more paper customization (in particular, 1/2 inch graph paper)
    (2 custom papers with settings in config file? 
     a folder with blank PDF or xoj papers and quick-access?)
    (also: engineering paper; isometric paper -- Dan Ott  Sep 4 '09)
- option to map a button to a context menu (incl. tool selection, ...)
- option to map a button to "undo"
- xournal_page-shadow.diff (Martin Kiefel Feb 5 2007)
- xoj2pdf on command line
- 'insert blank page after' command (more useful in PDF annot !)
- load images as bg if given on command-line (as with PDF on commandline)
- lasso selection tool (see shoffsta patch)
     (http://shoffsta.afraid.org/Projects/Xournal/)
- flatten (incl undo/redo...) - enabled only if nlayers>1
- color chooser (papercolor, pen color); maybe more default colors
  cf. ojb patch #2083103 adds paper color chooser
- printing: print-options, save printer settings (throughout a session,
   and on disk) (maybe a separate config file .xournal/gnome-print-settings)
- help index
- option for highlighter to be always at bottom of its layer
- more pen/highlighter shapes (chisel)
- slanted tip pens (calligraphy)
- toolbar buttons to access custom preset tools (e.g. text or pen with settings)
- text boxes with opaque background
- recalibration upon screen resize / compensation for miscalibration
    (use ConfigureNotify event and XInput? cf "Bugs" tracker 08/2007)
- find a better behavior for vertical space tool across page boundaries ?
   config options? 1) when there's not enough space at bottom of page:
                       - resize the page
                       - move stuff to next page
                       - move stuff to a new page
                   2) when moving to another page:
                       - move everything
                       - move only what doesn't fit (??? looks hard)
   option for vert space tool to also move the background??
   (PDF: cut-and-crop by running PDF code twice with 2 different clipboxes?)
- option to save all annotated files within the .xoj
- non-antialiased version for handhelds
- customize autogenerated save file names 
- layer dialog box to set visibility status of each layer regardless of
  which layer is being edited
- option to link layer creation and visibility status for all pages
  (Eric Borghs 04/15/08)
- display corruption on scroll down when bottom of window is obscured??
  (probably a gnomecanvas or X bug -- expose event generated for wrong
  region, or not processed?)
- autosave at a regular interval in a given location
- keep only a few pages of a PDF file in memory at any given time; generate
  pages by parsing pdf info rather than generating bitmaps for all of them.
- win32 port (Matteo Abrate)
- snap-to-grid tool? (Matteo Abrate)
- EPOS 7/24/07: Thumbnails pane
- EPOS: Connect to EPOS api which sends A4 mapped points
- EPOS: Cut and Paste into OpenOffice applications and the GIMP (as bitmap??)
- EPOS: Export pages to pictures in the Jpg and Png formats.
- EPOS: Rotate Ink in custom angle.
- handwriting recognition???? (cellwriter?) unlikely. we don't have grids
  see galileon comment on 2008-07-29 to tracker #1925309: word recognizer
- handwritten stroke search in document (see cellwriter?)
  (correlate inertia-normalized strokes in lift to unit cotangent bundle?)
- option: export to PDF with incremental pages for successive layers
    (for presentations) (Daniel Brugarth 8/18/07)
- Samuel Hoffstaetter: lasso, gettext localization, sidebar thumbnails, ...
- YoYo Siska patch for desktop mode ??
- Vivek Ayer: rotate paper wrt screen (for environments where display
  rotation doesn't work): gnome_canvas_item_affine_relative(canvas->root, ...)
  would rotate all but text items (still need to modify scroll bbox, and
  adjust event coordinates by inverse rotation).
- rotate PDF background pages (individually wrt each other, see #2099935)
- switch to libglade, and allow customization of key shortcuts (accels)

- command to copy a selected shape to a keybinding that will paste it
  (so one can define symbols to insert into typed notes)  (e.g. "be able
  to bind Ctrl-B to draw a \beta" for class notes). (shape, binding) sets are
  local to one session (different for different classes; but save them into
  the xoj file maybe ?) [Felix Giannelia 09/29/2009]
